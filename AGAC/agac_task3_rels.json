MC1R activation stimulates synthesis of black, strongly photoprotective eumelanin pigments. Several MC1R alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin, increased sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, and increased skin cancer risk. The MC1R gene is highly polymorphic, but only a few naturally occurring alleles have been functionally characterized, which complicates the establishment of accurate correlations between the signaling properties of mutant alleles and defined cutaneous phenotypes. We report the functional characterization of six MC1R alleles found in Spanish melanoma patients. Two variants (c.152T>C, p.Val51Ala and c.865T>C, p.Cys289Arg) have never been described, and the others (c.112G>A, p.Val38Met; c.122C>T, p.Ser41Phe; c.383T>C, p.Met128Thr; and c.842A>G, p.Asn281Ser) have not been analyzed for function. p.Asn281Ser corresponds to a functionally silent polymorphism. The other mutations are associated with varying degrees of loss of function (LOF), from moderate decreases in coupling to the cAMP pathway (p.Val38Met and p.Val51Ala) to nearly complete absence of functional coupling (p.Ser41Phe, p.Met128Thr, and p.Cys289Arg). The LOF p.Met128Thr and p.Cys289Arg mutants are trafficked to the cell surface, but are unable to bind agonists efficiently. Conversely, LOF of p.Val38Met, p.Ser41Phe, and p.Val51Ala is due to reduced cell surface expression as a consequence of retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

In addition to the loss of tumor suppression function and exertion of dominant-negative effects over the remaining wild-type protein, several p53 mutants can gain novel oncogenic functions (gain-of-function, GOF) that actively regulate cancer development and progression. In human endometrial cancer, p53 mutation is more often associated with aggressive nonendometrioid cancer. However, it was unknown if p53 mutants contributed to endometrial cancer progression through the GOF properties.\nMETHODS: To clarify the relationship between expression of p53 GOF mutation (p53-R175H) and invasive potential of human endometrial cancer KLE cells, we tested the consequences of up-regulation and down-regulation of p53-R175H in KLE cells by inducing p53-R175H expression vector or suppressing the p53 gene with short hairpin RNA.\nRESULTS: We found that forced over-expression of p53-R175H significantly promoted cell migration and invasion, and induced activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. Conversely, suppression of p53-R175H with short hairpin RNA significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion, and resulted in attenuation of EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway.\nCONCLUSION: These findings show for the first time that elevated expression of p53-R175H mutant may exert gain-of-function activity to activate the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway and thus may contribute to the invasive phenotype in endometrial cancer."}

Our previous data suggested that aberrant p53 proteins can enhance tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we examined potential mechanisms through which gain-of-function (GOF) p53 proteins can induce motility. Cells expressing GOF p53 -R175H, -R273H and -D281G showed enhanced migration, which was reversed by RNA interference (RNAi) or transactivation-deficient mutants. In cells with engineered or endogenous p53 mutants, enhanced migration was reduced by downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB2, a GOF p53 target. We found that GOF p53 proteins upregulate CXC-chemokine expression, the inflammatory mediators that contribute to multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. Elevated expression of CXCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL12 was found in cells expressing oncogenic p53. Transcription was elevated as CXCL5 and CXCL8 promoter activity was higher in cells expressing GOF p53, whereas wild-type p53 repressed promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed enhanced presence of acetylated histone H3 on the CXCL5 promoter in H1299/R273H cells, in agreement with increased transcriptional activity of the promoter, whereas RNAi-mediated repression of CXCL5 inhibited cell migration. Consistent with this, knockdown of the endogenous mutant p53 in lung cancer or melanoma cells reduced CXCL5 expression and cell migration. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA knockdown of mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced expression of a number of key targets, including several chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. Finally, CXCL5 expression was also elevated in lung tumor samples containing GOF p53, indicating relevance to human cancer. The data suggest a mechanistic link between GOF p53 proteins and chemokines in enhanced cell motility."}

Knock-down of mutant p53 in human lung cancer cell lines with different endogenous p53 mutants results in loss of GOF activity as shown by lowering of cell growth rate. Two lung cancer cell lines, ABC1 and H1437, carrying endogenous mutants p53-P278S and -R267P, show reduction in growth rate on knock-down on p53 levels. However, whereas reduction of the p53 level induces loss of tumorigenicity in nude mice for ABC1 cells, it escalates tumorigenicity for H1437 cells. We have tested their transactivation potential on p53 target gene promoters by performing transient transcriptional assays in the p53-null H1299 lung cancer cell line. Interestingly, while the mutant p53 target promoter Axl was activated by both the mutants, the p21 promoter was activated by p53-R267P and wild-type p53 but not by p53-P278S; showing a clear difference in transcriptional activity between the two mutants.

In spite of growing evidence that gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of p53 also have oncogenic activity, little is known about the clinical relevance of these mutations.\nMETHODS: The clinicopathological features of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa) patients with GOF p53 mutations were evaluated according to a comprehensive somatic mutation profile comprised of whole exome sequencing, mRNA expression, and protein expression profiles obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).\nRESULTS: Patients with a mutant p53 protein (mutp53) with a GOF mutation showed higher p53 mRNA and protein expression levels than patients with p53 mutation with no evidence of GOF (NE-GOF). GOF mutations were more likely to occur within mutational hotspots, and at CpG sites, and resulted in mutp53 with higher functional severity (FS) scores. Clinically, patients with GOF mutations showed a higher frequency of platinum resistance (22/58, 37.9%) than patients with NE-GOF mutations (12/56, 21.4%) (p=0.054). Furthermore, patients with GOF mutations were more likely to develop distant metastasis (36/55, 65.5%) than local recurrence (19/55, 34.5%), whereas patients with NE-GOF mutations showed a higher frequency of locoregional recurrence (26/47, 55.3%) than distant metastasis (21/47, 44.7%) (p=0.035). There were no differences in overall or progression-free survival between patients with GOF or NE-GOF mutp53.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that patient with GOF mutp53 is characterized by a greater likelihood of platinum treatment resistance and distant metastatic properties in HGS-OvCa."}

As suggested for most tumors, its capability to overgrow is probably driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs), and finding new targets to kill CSCs may be critical for improving patient survival. TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in cancers and mutant p53 protein (mutp53) can acquire gain of function (GOF) strongly contributing to malignancy. Studies thus far have not shown p53-GOF in osteosarcoma. Here, we investigated TP53 gene status/role in 3AB-OS cells-a highly aggressive CSC line previously selected from human osteosarcoma MG63 cells-to evaluate its involvement in promoting proliferation, invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis and stemness. By RT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR, fluorescent in situ hybridization, DNA sequence, western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, we have shown that-in comparison with parental MG63 cells where TP53 gene is hypermethylated, rearranged and in single copy-in 3AB-OS cells, TP53 is unmethylated, rearranged and in multiple copies, and mutp53 (p53-R248W/P72R) is post-translationally modified and with nuclear localization. p53-R248W/P72R-knockdown by short-interfering RNA reduced the growth and replication rate of 3AB-OS cells, markedly increasing cell cycle inhibitor levels and sensitized 3AB-OS cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by DR5 up-regulation; moreover, it strongly decreased the levels of stemness and invasiveness genes. We have also found that the ectopic expression of p53-R248W/P72R in MG63 cells promoted cancer stem-like features, as high proliferation rate, sphere formation, clonogenic growth, high migration and invasive ability; furthermore, it strongly increased the levels of stemness proteins.

The expression of \u03b2-catenin is observed in endodermal epithelia, including URS epithelia. We modulated the \u03b2-catenin gene conditionally in endodermal epithelia by utilizing tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver line (Shh(CreERT2)). Both \u03b2-catenin loss- and gain-of-function (LOF and GOF) mutants displayed abnormal clefts in the perineal region and hypoplastic elongation of the URS. The mutants also displayed reduced cell proliferation in the URS mesenchyme. In addition, the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants displayed reduced apoptosis and subsequently increased apoptosis in the URS epithelium. This instability possibly resulted in reduced expression levels of differentiation markers, such as keratin 1 and filaggrin, in the perineal epithelia. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) genes, such as Bmp4 and Bmp7, was also ectopically induced in the epithelia of the URS in the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants. The expression of the Msx2 gene and phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8, possible readouts of Bmp signaling, was also increased in the mutants.

The Shh(CreERT2/+); \u03b2-catenin(flox(ex3)/+); BmprIA(flox/-) mutants displayed partial restoration of URS elongation compared with the \u03b2-catenin GOF mutants.

MLK4 mutations have been identified in various human cancers, including frequently in colorectal cancer, where their function and pathobiological importance have been uncertain. In this study, we assessed the functional consequences of MLK4 mutations in colon tumorigenesis. Biochemical data indicated that a majority of MLK4 mutations are loss-of-function (LOF) mutations that can exert dominant-negative effects. In seeking to understand the abrogated activity of these mutants, we elucidated a new MLK4 catalytic domain structure. To determine whether MLK4 is required to maintain tumorigenic phenotypes, we reconstituted its signaling axis in colon cancer cells harboring MLK4-inactivating mutations. We found that restoring MLK4 activity reduced cell viability, proliferation, and colony formation in vitro and delayed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations established that restoring the function of MLK4 selectively induced the JNK pathway and its downstream targets, cJUN, ATF3, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN2B. Our work indicates that MLK4 is a novel tumor-suppressing kinase harboring frequent LOF mutations that lead to diminished signaling in the JNK pathway and enhanced proliferation in colon cancer.

The extensive genetic variation in this gene, especially common loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, has been established as primary risk factors for atopic dermatitis. To investigate the evolution of this gene, we analyzed 2,504 human genomes and genotyped the copy number variation of filaggrin repeats within FLG in 126 individuals from diverse ancestral backgrounds. We were unable to replicate a recent study claiming that LoF of FLG is adaptive in northern latitudes with lower ultraviolet light exposure. Instead, we present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that FLG genetic variation, including LoF variants, have little or no effect on fitness in modern humans. Haplotype-level scrutinization of the locus revealed signatures of a recent selective sweep in Asia, which increased the allele frequency of a haplotype group (Huxian haplogroup) in Asian populations. Functionally, we found that the Huxian haplogroup carries dozens of functional variants in FLG and hornerin (HRNR) genes, including those that are associated with atopic dermatitis susceptibility, HRNR expression levels and microbiome diversity on the skin. Our results suggest that the target of the adaptive sweep is HRNR gene function, and the functional FLG variants that involve susceptibility to atopic dermatitis, seem to hitchhike the selective sweep on HRNR.

The most frequent LoF mutation in human cancers is Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), causing aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway. In nearly all colon cancer tumors, the APC protein is truncated, but still retains partial binding abilities.\nOBJECTIVE & METHODS: Here, we tested the hypothesis that extracellular inhibitors of the Wnt pathway, although acting upstream of the APC mutation, can restore normal levels of pathway activity in colon cancer cells. To this end, we developed and simulated a mathematical model for the Wnt pathway in different APC mutants, with or without the effects of the extracellular inhibitors, Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein1 (sFRP1) and Dickhopf1 (Dkk1). We compared our model predictions to experimental data in the literature.\nRESULTS: Our model accurately predicts T-cell factor (TCF) activity in mutant cells that vary in APC mutation. Model simulations suggest that both sFRP1 and DKK1 can reduce TCF activity in APC1638N/1572T and Apcmin/min mutants, but restoration of normal activity levels is possible only in the former. When applied in combination, synergism between the two inhibitors can reduce their effective doses to one-fourth of the doses required under single inhibitor application. Overall, re-establishment of normal Wnt pathway activity is predicted for every APC mutant in whom TCF activity is increased by up to 11 fold.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that extracellular inhibitors can effectively restore normal Wnt pathway activity in APC-truncated cancer cells, even though these LoF mutations occur downstream of the inhibitory action. The insufficient activity of the truncated APC can be quantitatively balanced by the upstream intervention. This new concept of upstream intervention to control the effects of downstream mutations may be considered also for other partial LoF mutations in other signaling pathways."}

Genotype-phenotype correlation has been suggested without assessment of ALMS1 expression.\nMETHODS: ALMS1 expression (real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry) and cilia formation (immunocytochemistry) were assessed in fibroblasts from deeply phenotyped volunteers diagnosed with AS recruited from a dedicated AS Service. Exome sequencing was used in two participants without convincing biallelic ALMS1 mutations, and BBS2 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2) protein expression was assessed in one patient with biallelic BBS2 mutations. Hedgehog-induced GLI1 expression and PDGFA signaling was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, or immunostaining of fixed cells after stimulation.\nRESULTS: In 16 of the patient cell lines examined, ALMS1 protein was undetectable (14 with biallelic loss-of-function (LoF) mutations), and in two, ALMS1 staining was equivocal (one with biallelic LoF mutations). In five lines, ALMS1 expression was normal using at least one fixation method (one with biallelic LoF mutations). These differences were not accounted for by major differences in ALMS1 mRNA expression. Exome sequencing of two participants with normal ALMS1 expression identified biallelic LoF BBS2 mutations in one. No second, known ciliopathy mutation was found in the other patient, who had one LoF ALMS1 mutation. Phenotypes were milder or atypical in participants with preserved ALMS1 immunostaining, even when two with likely alternative genetic diagnoses were excluded. All cells studied developed normal cilia, ALMS1 and BBS2 mutant cells showed normal Hedgehog-induced upregulation of GLI1 expression, and PDGFA signaling was normal in ALMS1-deficient cells.\nCONCLUSION: Milder or atypical presentations of AS should prompt genetic evaluation for alternative, clinically overlapping ciliopathies. A subgroup of patients with bona fide ALMS1 defects have milder phenotypes due to residual ALMS1 expression, which may be more important than mutation site."}

Previous studies identified mutations in ARHGAP29 associated with an increased risk for NSCL/P. To investigate the effects of ARHGAP29 in vivo, we generated a novel murine allele by inserting a point mutation identified in a patient with NSCL/P. This single-nucleotide variation of ARHGAP29 translates to an early nonsense mutation (K326X), presumably resulting in loss-of-function (LoF). Embryos from Arhgap29(K326X/+) intercrosses were harvested at various time points. No homozygous Arhgap29(K326X) animals were found in the 45 analyzed litters, assessed as early as embryonic day 8.5 (e8.5). Coronal sectioning of e13.5 and e14.5 heads revealed that 59% of Arhgap29(K326X/+) mice ( n = 37) exhibited improper epithelial contact between developing oral structures, while none were observed in wild types ( n = 10). In addition, Arhgap29(K326X/+) embryos exhibited a significantly higher percentage of maxillary epithelium in contact with mandibular epithelium. Immunofluorescent analyses of the periderm and oral adhesions revealed the presence of Arhgap29 in periderm cells. These cells were p63 negative, keratin 17 positive, and keratin 6 positive and present at sites of adhesion, although occasionally disorganized. Oral adhesions did not appear to impair palatogenesis, as all analyzed Arhgap29(K326X/+) embryos showed confluent palatal mesenchyme and epithelium at e18.5 ( n = 16), and no mice were found with a cleft at birth. Collectively, our data demonstrate that ARHGAP29 is required for embryonic survival and that heterozygosity for LoF variants of Arhgap29 increases the incidence and length of oral adhesions at a critical time point during orofacial development. In conclusion, we validate the LoF nature of the human K326X mutation in vivo and reveal a previously unknown effect of Arhgap29 in murine craniofacial development."}

Young individuals with AF have a strong genetic association with the disease, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood.\nObjective: To perform large-scale whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variants related to AF.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program includes longitudinal and cohort studies that underwent high-depth whole-genome sequencing between 2014 and 2017 in 18\u202f526 individuals from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Barbados, and Samoa. This case-control study included 2781 patients with early-onset AF from 9 studies and identified 4959 controls of European ancestry from the remaining participants. Results were replicated in the UK Biobank (346\u202f546 participants) and the MyCode Study (42\u202f782 participants).\nExposures: Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in genes at AF loci and common genetic variation across the whole genome.\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Early-onset AF (defined as AF onset in persons <66 years of age). Due to multiple testing, the significance threshold for the rare variant analysis was P\u2009=\u20094.55\u2009\u00d7\u200910-3.\nResults: Among 2781 participants with early-onset AF (the case group), 72.1% were men, and the mean (SD) age of AF onset was 48.7 (10.2) years. Participants underwent whole-genome sequencing at a mean depth of 37.8 fold and mean genome coverage of 99.1%. At least 1 LOF variant in TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein titin, was present in 2.1% of case participants compared with 1.1% in control participants (odds ratio [OR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.04-2.97]). The proportion of individuals with early-onset AF who carried a LOF variant in TTN increased with an earlier age of AF onset (P value for trend, 4.92\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), and 6.5% of individuals with AF onset prior to age 30 carried a TTN LOF variant (OR, 5.94 [95% CI, 2.64-13.35]; P\u2009=\u20091.65\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5). The association between TTN LOF variants and AF was replicated in an independent study of 1582 patients with early-onset AF (cases) and 41\u202f200 control participants (OR, 2.16 [95% CI, 1.19-3.92]; P\u2009=\u2009.01).\nConclusions and Relevance: In a case-control study, there was a statistically significant association between an LOF variant in the TTN gene and early-onset AF, with the variant present in a small percentage of participants with early-onset AF (the case group). Further research is necessary to understand whether this is a causal relationship."}

Here we describe how deficiency of CYBC1, a previously uncharacterized protein in humans (C17orf62), leads to reduced expression of NADPH oxidase's main subunit (gp91phox) and results in CGD. Analyzing two brothers diagnosed with CGD we identify a homozygous loss-of-function mutation, p.Tyr2Ter, in CYBC1. Imputation of p.Tyr2Ter into 155K chip-genotyped Icelanders reveals six additional homozygotes, all with signs of CGD, manifesting as colitis, rare infections, or a severely impaired PMA-induced neutrophil oxidative burst. Homozygosity for p.Tyr2Ter consequently associates with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Iceland (P\u2009=\u20098.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8; OR\u2009=\u200967.6), as well as reduced height (P\u2009=\u20093.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; -8.5\u2009cm).

The prevalence of ERBB2/HER2 mutation in bone metastasis of breast cancer and the associated phenotype are not known. In this study, bone metastases from breast cancer patients (n\u2009=\u2009231) were analyzed for ERBB2/HER2 mutation. In 7 patients (3%; median age 70\u00a0years, range 50-83\u00a0years), gain-of-function mutations of ERBB2/HER2 were detected. The most frequent mutation was p.L755S (71%). In 29% of mutated cases, p.V777L was found. Lobular breast cancer was present in 71% of mutated cases (n\u2009=\u20095) and in 49% of all samples (n\u2009=\u2009231; p\u2009=\u20090.275). Mutation frequency was 4.4% in the lobular subgroup and 17.4% in the pleomorphic subtype of lobular cancer (n\u2009=\u200923), respectively. All but one mutated lobular cancers were of the pleomorphic subtype (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Mutated cancers belonged either to the luminal (n\u2009=\u20094) or to the triple-negative types (n\u2009=\u20093). With regard to protein expression and gene amplification, HER2 was negative in all mutated cases. Among the 14% of metastatic luminal cancers with estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) mutation, conveying resistance against aromatase inhibitors, no concomitant ERBB2/HER2 mutation occurred. We conclude that activating HER2 mutation is present in about 3% of bone metastases from breast cancers, with significantly higher rates in the pleomorphic subtype of lobular cancer. Since mutated cases appear to be HER2-negative by conventional testing, the opportunity for specific anti-HER2 therapy may be missed."}

LMS is associated with mutations in exon 33 of NOTCH3 leading to a truncated protein lacking sequences for NOTCH3 degradation and presumably causing NOTCH3 gain of function. To create a mouse model reproducing human LMS-associated mutations, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce a tandem termination codon at bases 6691-6696 (ACCAAG\u2192TAATGA) and verified this mutation (Notch3tm1.1Ecan ) by DNA sequencing of F1 mice. One-month-old male and female heterozygous Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice had cancellous and cortical bone osteopenia but exhibited no obvious neurological alterations, and histopathology of multiple organs revealed no abnormalities. Microcomputed tomography of these mutants revealed a 35-60% decrease in cancellous bone volume associated with a reduction in trabecular number and decreased connectivity. During maturation, cancellous and cortical bones were restored in female but not in male mice, which exhibited cancellous bone osteopenia at 4 months. Cancellous bone histomorphometry revealed increased osteoblast and osteocyte numbers and a modest increase in osteoclast surface and bone formation rate. Notch3tm1.1Ecan calvarial osteoblasts had increased proliferation and increased bone \u03b3-carboxyglutamate protein (Bglap) and TNF superfamily member 11 (Tnfsf11) mRNA levels and lower Tnfrsf11b levels. Tnfsf11 mRNA was increased in osteocyte-rich femora from Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice. Cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages from Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice revealed increased osteoclast formation, particularly in cocultures with osteoblasts from Notch3tm1.1Ecan mice. In conclusion, the Notch3tm1.1Ecan mutation causes osteopenia despite an increase in osteoblast proliferation and function and is associated with enhanced Tnfsf11 expression in osteoblasts and osteocytes."}

Phenotypes associated with these mutations varied from males with spontaneous puberty, substantial T production, and possible fertility, to females with and without m\u00fcllerian structures and primary amenorrhea.\nCONCLUSION(S): We describe six novel mutations in NR5A1 gene and showed that they might affect protein structure, therefore compromising seriously the SF-1 role in regulating gonadal development. Clinically, we suggest that NR5A1 analysis should be performed whenever atypical sex organs are evidenced or there is an abnormal sexual development, to have proper diagnosis and better management of patients."}

Here we report that germline loss of function mutations in TRIM28 predispose children to Wilms tumour. Loss of function of this transcriptional co-repressor, which has a role in nephrogenesis, has not previously been associated with cancer. Inactivation of TRIM28, either germline or somatic, occurred through inactivating mutations, loss of heterozygosity or epigenetic silencing. TRIM28-mutated tumours had a monomorphic epithelial histology that is uncommon for Wilms tumour. Critically, these tumours were negative for TRIM28 immunohistochemical staining whereas the epithelial component in normal tissue and other Wilms tumours stained positively. These data, together with a characteristic gene expression profile, suggest that inactivation of TRIM28 provides the molecular basis for defining a previously described subtype of Wilms tumour, that has early age of onset and excellent prognosis."}

It is overexpressed in tumors and has anti-inflammatory properties. The protein may be cleaved into granulins which display pro-inflammatory properties. In 2006, mutations in progranulin gene (GRN) that cause haploinsufficiency were found in familial cases of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Patients with null mutations in GRN display very low-plasma PGRN levels; this analysis is useful for identifying mutation carriers, independent of the clinical presentation, and in those before the appearance of symptoms. Areas covered: Here, we review the current knowledge of PGRN physiological functions and GRN mutations associated with FTD; we also summarize state of the art clinical trials and those compounds able to replace PGRN loss in preclinical models. Expert opinion: PGRN represents a promising therapeutic target for FTD. Cohorts suitable for treatment, ideally at the preclinical stage, where pathogenic mechanisms ongoing in the brain are targeted, are available. However, PGRN may have side effects, such as the risk of tumorigenesis, and the risk/benefit ratio of any intervention cannot be predicted. Furthermore, at present, the situation is complicated by the absence of adequate outcome measures."}

Here, we report the identification of a distinct syndrome due to de novo or inherited heterozygous mutations in Tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2) in 38 unrelated individuals and two affected mothers, using whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing technologies, matchmaker databases, and international collaborations. Affected individuals had a consistent phenotype, characterized by mild-borderline neurodevelopmental delay (86%), behavioral disorders (68%), severe gastro-intestinal problems (63%), and facial dysmorphism including blepharophimosis (82%), telecanthus (74%), prominent nasal bridge (68%), broad nasal tip (66%), thin vermilion of the upper lip (62%), and upslanting palpebral fissures (55%). Analysis of cell lines from three affected individuals showed that mutations act through a loss-of-function mechanism in at least two case subjects. Genotype-phenotype analysis and comparison of computationally modeled faces showed that phenotypes of these and other individuals with loss-of-function variants significantly overlapped with phenotypes of individuals with other variant types (missense and C-terminal truncating). This suggests that haploinsufficiency of TLK2 is the most likely underlying disease mechanism, leading to a consistent neurodevelopmental phenotype. This work illustrates the power of international data sharing, by the identification of 40 individuals from 26 different centers in 7 different countries, allowing the identification, clinical delineation, and genotype-phenotype evaluation of a distinct NDD caused by mutations in TLK2."}

Whole-exome sequencing of the patient's DNA revealed a heterozygous de novo variant in the KCNJ6 (c.512T>G, p.Leu171Arg). We conducted in vitro functional studies to determine if this Leu-to-Arg mutation alters the function of GIRK2 channels. Heterologous expression of the mutant GIRK2 channel alone produced an aberrant basal inward current that lacked G protein activation, lost K+ selectivity and gained Ca2+ permeability. Notably, the inward current was inhibited by the Na+ channel blocker QX-314, similar to the previously reported weaver mutation in murine GIRK2. Expression of a tandem dimer containing GIRK1 and GIRK2(p.Leu171Arg) did not lead to any currents, suggesting heterotetramers are not functional. In neurons expressing p.Leu171Arg GIRK2 channels, these changes in channel properties would be expected to generate a sustained depolarization, instead of the normal G protein-gated inhibitory response, which could be mitigated by expression of other GIRK subunits. The identification of the p.Leu171Arg GIRK2 mutation potentially expands the Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome phenotype to include severe dystonia and ballismus. Our study suggests screening for dominant KCNJ6 mutations in the evaluation of patients with severe movement disorders, which could provide evidence to support a causal role of KCNJ6 in neurological channelopathies."}

Perturbing these autoinhibitory constraints, resulting in protein destabilization, is one of many mechanisms by which PKC function is lost in cancer. Here, we address how a gain-of-function germline mutation in PKC\u03b1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) enhances signaling without increasing vulnerability to down-regulation. Biochemical analyses of purified protein demonstrate that this mutation results in an \u223c30% increase in the catalytic rate of the activated enzyme, with no changes in the concentrations of Ca2+ or lipid required for half-maximal activation. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this mutation has both localized and allosteric effects, most notably decreasing the dynamics of the C-helix, a key determinant in the catalytic turnover of kinases. Consistent with this mutation not altering autoinhibitory constraints, live-cell imaging studies reveal that the basal signaling output of PKC\u03b1-M489V is unchanged. However, the mutant enzyme in cells displays increased sensitivity to an inhibitor that is ineffective toward scaffolded PKC, suggesting the altered dynamics of the kinase domain may influence protein interactions. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of a key PKC substrate, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate, is increased in brains of CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited mice containing the PKC\u03b1-M489V mutation. Our results unveil how an AD-associated mutation in PKC\u03b1 permits enhanced agonist-dependent signaling via a mechanism that evades the cell's homeostatic down-regulation of constitutively active PKC\u03b1."}

We exome sequenced 202 individuals with sporadic PVNH to identify novel genetic risk loci. We first performed a trio-based analysis and identified 219 de novo variants. Although no novel genes were implicated in this initial analysis, PVNH cases were found overall to have a significant excess of nonsynonymous de novo variants in intolerant genes (p = 3.27x10-7), suggesting a role for rare new alleles in genes yet to be associated with the condition. Using a gene-level collapsing analysis comparing cases and controls, we identified a genome-wide significant signal driven by four ultra-rare loss-of-function heterozygous variants in MAP1B, including one de novo variant. In at least one instance, the MAP1B variant was inherited from a parent with previously undiagnosed PVNH. The PVNH was frontally predominant and associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria. These results implicate MAP1B in PVNH. More broadly, our findings suggest that detrimental mutations likely arising in immediately preceding generations with incomplete penetrance may also be responsible for some apparently sporadic diseases."}

We identified loss-of-function mutations in the open-reading frame C11orf70 in PCD individuals from five distinct families. Transmission electron microscopy analyses and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in C11orf70 cause immotility of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, respectively, as a result of the loss of axonemal outer (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs), indicating that C11orf70 is involved in cytoplasmic assembly of dynein arms. Expression analyses of C11orf70 showed that C11orf70 is expressed in ciliated respiratory cells and that the expression of C11orf70 is upregulated during ciliogenesis, similar to other previously described cytoplasmic dynein-arm assembly factors. Furthermore, C11orf70 shows an interaction with cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2, supporting our hypothesis that C11orf70 is a preassembly factor involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. The identification of additional genetic defects that cause PCD and male infertility is of great importance for the clinic as well as for genetic counselling."}

As such, loss-of-function (LOF) PCSK9 variants that fail to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) increase hepatic LDLR levels and lower the risk of developing CVD. The retention of misfolded protein in the ER can cause ER stress and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). In this study, we investigated whether a variety of LOF PCSK9 variants that are retained in the ER can cause ER stress and hepatic cytotoxicity. Although overexpression of these PCSK9 variants caused an accumulation in the ER of hepatocytes, UPR activation or apoptosis was not observed. Furthermore, ER retention of endogenous PCSK9 via splice switching also failed to induce the UPR. Consistent with these in vitro studies, overexpression of PCSK9 in the livers of mice had no impact on UPR activation. To elucidate the cellular mechanism to explain these surprising findings, we observed that the 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP94) sequesters PCSK9 away from the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), the major activator of the UPR. As a result, GRP94 knockdown increased the stability of GRP78-PCSK9 complex and resulted in UPR activation following overexpression of ER-retained PCSK9 variants relative to WT secreted controls. Given that overexpression of these LOF PCSK9 variants does not cause UPR activation under normal homeostatic conditions, therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the autocatalytic cleavage of PCSK9 in the ER represent a viable strategy for reducing circulating PCSK9."}

Recent studies have uncovered an oncogenic role of mutations in the CSF3R gene in many hematologic malignancies. To find additional CSF3R mutations that give rise to cell transformation, we performed a cellular transformation assay in which murine interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 cells were transduced with WT CSF3R plasmid and screened for spontaneous growth in the absence of IL-3. Any outgrowth clones were sequenced to identify CSF3R mutations with transformation capacity. We identified several novel mutations and determined that they transform cells via four distinct mechanisms: 1) cysteine- and disulfide bond-mediated dimerization (S581C); 2) polar, noncharged amino acid substitution at the transmembrane helix dimer interface at residue Thr-640; 3) increased internalization by a Glu-524 substitution that mimics a low G-CSF dose; and 4) hydrophobic amino acid substitutions in the membrane-proximal residues Thr-612, Thr-615, and Thr-618. Furthermore, the change in signaling activation was related to an altered CSF3R localization. We also found that CSF3R-induced STAT3 and ERK activations require CSF3R internalization, whereas STAT5 activation occurred at the cell surface. Cumulatively, we have expanded the regions of the CSF3R extracellular and transmembrane domains in which missense mutations exhibit leukemogenic capacity and have further elucidated the mechanistic underpinnings that underlie altered CSF3R expression, dimerization, and signaling activation."}

Mind Bomb is an essential E3 ligase during Notch pathway signaling in insects and vertebrates. While Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a Mind Bomb homolog (mib-1), it has never been recovered in the extensive Notch suppressor/enhancer screens that have identified numerous pathway components. Here, we show that C. elegans mib-1 null mutants have a spermatogenesis-defective phenotype that results in a heterogeneous mixture of arrested spermatocytes, defective spermatids, and motility-impaired spermatozoa. mib-1 mutants also have chromosome segregation defects during meiosis, molecular null mutants are intrinsically temperature-sensitive, and many mib-1 spermatids contain large amounts of tubulin. These phenotypic features are similar to the endogenous RNA intereference (RNAi) mutants, but mib-1 mutants do not affect RNAi. MIB-1 protein is expressed throughout the germ line with peak expression in spermatocytes followed by segregation into the residual body during spermatid formation.

Our research demonstrates that FAMA is also an essential component of B. cinerea resistance. The fama loss-of-function mutants (fama-1 and fama-2) increased susceptibility to B. cinerea infection and reduced defense-gene expression.

Recently, SCN5A mutations have been linked to the clinical entity multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions (MEPPC) characterized by ventricular ectopy and dilated cardiomyopathy.\nMETHODS & RESULTS: A family with a uniform MEPPC-like phenotype, associated with complex atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy caused by a high frequency of ventricular ectopy was clinically assessed. Screening of the SCN5A gene revealed a missense mutation in the linker between segments 3 and 4 in domain 1 of the Nav1.5 protein, resulting in a glycine to aspartate substitution at position 213 (G213D). The phenotype co-segregated with the missense mutation. Electrophysiological studies of wild type (WT) hNav1.5 and hNav1.5_G213D expressed in CHO-K cells showed that the voltage of half-maximal activation (V\u00bd) was significantly more negative for hNav1.5_G213D compared to WT (V\u00bd=-38.7\u00b10.5mV for WT and V\u00bd=-42.4\u00b10.5mV for G213D; P<0.001). This suggests activation of Nav1.5_G231D at more negative potentials. The V\u00bd of steady-state inactivation was significantly shifted towards more positive values for Nav1.5_G213D (V\u00bd=-86.7\u00b10.2mV for WT and -82.2\u00b10.3mV for G213D; P<0.001), also contributing to a gain-of-function phenotype. Flecainide and amiodarone markedly reduced premature atrial and ventricular contractions in four patients.\nCONCLUSION: The Nav1.5_G213D mutation is associated with a gain-of-function phenotype, multifocal atrial and ventricular ectopy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Since patients with a MEPPC-like phenotype may specifically benefit from Class-1 antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone, clinical identification of this disease entity is important."}

Notably, mutations were observed in different functional domains: in addition to three catalytic domain mutations, two missense mutations were found in the auto-inhibitory (AI) domain. One additional frameshift insertion that caused premature termination was also identified. Detailed clinical evaluation of the six individuals revealed clinically unexpected consequences of the PPP3CA mutations. First, the catalytic domain mutations and frameshift mutation were consistently found in patients with nonsyndromic early onset epileptic encephalopathy. In contrast, the AI domain mutations were associated with multiple congenital abnormalities including craniofacial dysmorphism, arthrogryposis and short stature. In addition, one individual showed severe skeletal developmental defects, namely, severe craniosynostosis and gracile bones (severe bone slenderness and perinatal fractures). Using a yeast model system, we showed that the catalytic and AI domain mutations visibly result in decreased and increased calcineurin signaling, respectively. These findings indicate that different functional effects of PPP3CA mutations are associated with two distinct disorders and suggest that functional approaches using a simple cellular system provide a tool for resolving complex genotype-phenotype correlations."}

Mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is one of the most prevalent findings in this heterogeneous disease. The major types of mutations in FLT3 can be categorized as internal tandem duplications (ITD) and point mutations. Recent studies suggest that ITDs not only occur in the juxtamembrane region as originally described, but also in the kinase domain. Although the juxtamembrane ITDs have been well characterized, the tyrosine kinase domain ITDs have not yet been thoroughly studied due to their recent discovery. For this reason, we compared ITD mutations in the juxtamembrane domain with those in the tyrosine kinase domain, as well as with the most common activating point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain, D835Y. The purpose of this study was to understand whether it is the nature of the mutation or the location of the mutation that plays the main role in leukemogenesis. The various FLT3 mutants were expressed in the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 and examined for their capacity to form colonies in semisolid medium. The size and number of colonies formed by Ba/F3 cells expressing either the internal tandem duplication within juxtamembrane\u00a0domain of the receptor (JMD-ITD) or the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD)-ITD were indistinguishable, while Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y/FLT3 failed to form colonies. Cell proliferation and cell survival was also significantly higher in TKD-ITD expressing cells, compared to cells expressing D835Y/FLT3. Furthermore, TKD-ITD is capable of inducing phosphorylation of STAT5, while D835Y/FLT3 fails to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Other signal transduction pathways such as the RAS/ERK and the PI3K/AKT pathways were activated to the same level in TKD-ITD cells as compared to D835Y/FLT3 expressing cells. Taken together, our data suggest that TKD-ITD displays similar oncogenic potential to the JMD-ITD but a higher oncogenic potential than the D835Y point mutation."}

Gain-of-function mutations in the 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene induce resistance to 6-mercaptopurine and are selectively present in relapsed ALL. Yet, the mechanisms involved in NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia, disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2+/R367Q mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts. These results identify the fitness cost of NT5C2 mutation and resistance to chemotherapy as key evolutionary drivers that shape clonal evolution in relapsed ALL and support a role for IMPDH inhibition in the treatment of ALL."}

FS is typically lethal in the fetal or neonatal period. Inheritance is presumed autosomal recessive. Although no major genetic cause has been identified for FS, biallelic truncating variants in PIGN, encoding a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis pathway, have been identified in a limited number of cases with a phenotype compatible with FS. Biallelic variants in PIGN, typically missense or compound missense with truncating, also cause multiple congenital anomalies-hypotonia-seizures syndrome 1 (MCAHS1). Here we report six further patients with FS with or without congenital diaphragmatic hernia and recessive loss of function PIGN alleles, including an intragenic deletion with a likely founder effect in La R\u00e9union and other Indian Ocean islands. Our results support the hypothesis that a spectrum of phenotypic severity is associated with recessive PIGN variants, ranging from FS at the extreme end, caused by complete loss of function, to MCAHS1, in which some residual PIGN function may remain.

In addition, the mutation rate for SHP2 is the highest for colorectal cancer (CRC) among solid tumors. The E76K GOF mutation is the most common and active SHP2 mutation; however, the pathogenic effects and function of this mutation in CRC tumor progression have not been well characterized. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) signaling pathway is crucial for CRC, and excessive activation of this pathway has been observed in several tumors. We used Ptpn11E76K conditional knock-in mice to study this GOF mutation in colitis-associated CRC (CAC) and used the CRC cell lines HT29 and HCT116 to determine the relationship between SHP2 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Ptpn11E76K conditional knock-in mice exhibited aggravated inflammation and increased CAC tumorigenesis. In vitro, SHP2E76K and SHP2WT promoted malignant biological behaviors of CRC cells and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

In this study, the coding exons and splicing boundaries of the NR2F2 gene, which encodes a pleiotropic transcription factor required for normal cardiovascular development, were sequenced in 168 unrelated patients with CHD, and a novel mutation (c.247G\u00a0>\u00a0T, equivalent to p.G83X) was detected in a patient with double outlet right ventricle as well as ventricular septal defect. Genetic scanning of the mutation carrier's relatives available showed that the mutation was present in all affected family members but absent in unaffected family members. Analysis of the index patient's pedigree displayed that the mutation co-segregated with CHD, which was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. The nonsense mutation was absent in 230 unrelated, ethnically-matched healthy individuals used as controls. Functional deciphers by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system revealed that the mutant NR2F2 protein had no transcriptional activity as compared with its wild-type counterpart. Furthermore, the mutation abrogated the synergistic transcriptional activation between NR2F2 and GATA4, another core cardiac transcription factor associated with CHD.

About 90% of these mutations encode missense mutant proteins that span ~190 different codons localized in the DNA-binding domain of the gene and protein. These mutations produce a protein with a reduced capacity to bind to a specific DNA sequence that regulates the p53 transcriptional pathway. Eight of these mutations are localized in codons that account for ~28% of the total p53 mutations and these alleles appear to be selected for preferentially in human cancers of many tissue types. This article explores the question 'Why are there hotspot mutations in the p53 gene in human cancers?' Four possible reasons for this are considered; (1) the hotspot mutant alleles produce a protein that has a highly altered structure, (2) environmental mutagens produce allele-specific changes in the p53 gene, (3) these mutations arise at selected sites in the gene due to a specific DNA sequence, such as a methylated cytosine residue in a CpG dinucleotide, which has a higher mutation rate changing C to T nucleotides, (4) along with the observed change in mutant p53 proteins, which produce a loss of function (DNA binding and transcription), some mutant proteins have an allele-specific gain of function that promotes cancer. Evidence is presented that demonstrates the first three possibilities all contribute some property to this list of hotspot mutations. The fourth possibility remains to be tested."}

We identified HCN2 missense variants from a large cohort of 585 GGE patients, recruited by the Epilepsy Phenome-Genome Project (EPGP), and performed functional analysis using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes. The p.S632W variant was identified in a patient with idiopathic photosensitive occipital epilepsy and segregated in the family. This variant was also independently identified in an unrelated patient with childhood absence seizures from a European cohort of 238 familial GGE cases.

Recent evidence has suggested a role of LRRK2, linked to the most frequent familial PD, in regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking. However, the mechanism whereby LRRK2 mutants contribute to nigral vulnerability remains unclear. Here we show that the most common PD mutation LRRK2 G2019S impairs SV endocytosis in ventral midbrain (MB) neurons, including DA neurons, and the slowed endocytosis can be rescued by inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity. A similar endocytic defect, however, was not observed in LRRK2 mutant neurons from the neocortex (hereafter, cortical neurons) or the hippocampus, suggesting a brain region-specific vulnerability to the G2019S mutation.

Recently, mechanistic studies proved the ability of parkin in regulating mitochondria homeostasis and microtubule (MT) stability. Looking at these systems during aging of PARK2 knockout mice, we found that loss of parkin induced an accelerated (over)acetylation of MT system both in dopaminergic neuron cell bodies and fibers, localized in the substantia nigra and corpus striatum, respectively. Interestingly, in PARK2 knockout mice, changes of MT stability preceded the alteration of mitochondria transport. Moreover, in-cell experiments confirmed that loss of parkin affects mitochondria mobility and showed that this defect depends on MT system as it is rescued by paclitaxel, a well-known MT-targeted agent. Furthermore, both in PC12 neuronal cells and in patients' induced pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain neurons, we observed that parkin deficiencies cause the fragmentation of stable MTs.

Multiple lines of evidence link the ITGB3 gene encoding the integrin \u03b23 subunit with the serotonin (5-HT) system, likely via its modulation of the 5-HT transporter (SERT). The ITGB3 coding polymorphism Leu33Pro (rs5918, PlA2) produces hyperactive \u03b1v\u03b23 receptors that influence whole-blood 5-HT levels and may influence the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a phenome-wide scan of psychiatric diagnoses, we found significant, male-specific associations between the Pro33 allele and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and ASDs. Here, we used knock-in (KI) mice expressing an Itgb3 variant that phenocopies the human Pro33 variant to elucidate the consequences of constitutively enhanced \u03b1v\u03b23 signaling to the 5-HT system in the brain. KI mice displayed deficits in multiple behaviors, including anxiety, repetitive, and social behaviors. Anatomical studies revealed a significant decrease in 5-HT synapses in the midbrain, accompanied by decreases in SERT activity and reduced localization of SERTs to integrin adhesion complexes in synapses of KI mice. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) rescued SERT function in synapses of KI mice, demonstrating that constitutive active FAK signaling downstream of the Pro32Pro33 integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 suppresses SERT activity. Our studies identify a complex regulation of 5-HT homeostasis and behaviors by integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, revealing an important role for integrins in modulating risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The integrin \u03b23 Leu33Pro coding polymorphism has been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) within a subgroup of patients with elevated blood 5-HT levels, linking integrin \u03b23, 5-HT, and ASD risk. We capitalized on these interactions to demonstrate that the Pro33 coding variation in the murine integrin \u03b23 recapitulates the sex-dependent neurochemical and behavioral attributes of ASD. Using state-of-the-art techniques, we show that presynaptic 5-HT function is altered in these mice, and that the localization of 5-HT transporters to specific compartments within the synapse, disrupted by the integrin \u03b23 Pro33 mutation, is critical for appropriate reuptake of 5-HT. Our studies provide fundamental insight into the genetic network regulating 5-HT neurotransmission in the CNS that is also associated with ASD risk."}

Survival in male hemizygotes for such mutations is dependent on retention of residual FLNA function but it is unclear why a subgroup of males with mutations in the 5' end of the gene can present with CIPO alone. Here, we demonstrate evidence for the presence of two FLNA isoforms differing by 28 residues at the N-terminus initiated at ATG+1 and ATG+82 . A male with CIPO (c.18_19del) exclusively expressed FLNA ATG+82 , implicating the longer protein isoform (ATG+1 ) in smooth muscle development. In contrast, mutations leading to reduction of both isoforms are associated with compound phenotypes affecting the brain, heart, and intestine. RNA-seq data revealed three distinct transcription start sites, two of which produce a protein isoform utilizing ATG+1 while the third utilizes ATG+82 . Transcripts sponsoring translational initiation at ATG+1 predominate in intestinal smooth muscle, and are more abundant compared with the level measured in fibroblasts. Together these observations describe a new mechanism of tissue-specific regulation of FLNA that could reflect the differing mechanical requirements of these cell types during development."}

Other findings included bilateral partial cutaneous syndactyly of 2nd and 3rd fingers, history of impacted teeth with dentigerous cyst in the elder one, and intellectual disability (mild and borderline). The sisters were considered to have Elsahy-Waters syndrome. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular cause, sisters and their healthy parents were genotyped by SNP arrays, followed by homozygosity mapping. Homozygous regions were further analyzed by exome sequencing in one affected individual. A homozygous indel variant segregating with the condition was detected in CDH11 (c.1116_1117delinsGATCATCAG, p.(Ile372MetfsTer9)), which was then validated by using Sanger sequencing. CDH11 encodes cadherin 11 (osteo-cadherin) that regulates cell-cell adhesion, cell polarization and migration, as well as osteogenic differentiation. Further experiments revealed that CDH11 expression was decreased in patient-derived fibroblasts as compared to the heterozygous parent and another healthy donor. Immunostaining showed absence of the protein expression in patient fibroblasts. In addition, cell proliferation rate was slow and osteogenic differentiation potential was delayed. We consider that this study reveals loss-of-function mutations in CDH11 as a probable cause of this phenotype. Next generation sequencing in further patients would both prove this gene as causative, and finely delineate this clinical spectrum further contributing in identification of other possibly involved gene(s)."}

Because HHT is caused by loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9)-ALK1-Smad1/5/8 signaling, interventions aimed at activating this pathway are of therapeutic value. We interrogated the whole-transcriptome in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) and found that ALK1 signaling inhibition was associated with a specific pro-angiogenic gene expression signature, which included a significant elevation of DLL4 expression. By screening the NIH clinical collections of FDA-approved drugs, we identified tacrolimus (FK-506) as the most potent activator of ALK1 signaling in BMP9-challenged C2C12 reporter cells. In HUVECs, tacrolimus activated Smad1/5/8 and opposed the pro-angiogenic gene expression signature associated with ALK1 loss-of-function, by notably reducing Dll4 expression. In these cells, tacrolimus also inhibited Akt and p38 stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor, a major driver of angiogenesis. In the BMP9/10-immunodepleted postnatal retina-a mouse model of HHT vascular pathology-tacrolimus activated endothelial Smad1/5/8 and prevented the Dll4 overexpression and hypervascularization associated with this model. Finally, tacrolimus stimulated Smad1/5/8 signaling in C2C12 cells expressing BMP9-unresponsive ALK1 HHT mutants and in HHT patient blood outgrowth ECs.

Recently, functional activation of the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R) was discovered to be another driving force in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

We report a three-generation family in which six members present clinical symptoms of paramyotonia congenita characterized by a marked worsening of myotonia by cold and by the presence of clear episodes of paralysis. We identified a novel mutation in SCN4A (Asn1366Ser, N1366S) in all patients in the family but not in healthy relatives or in 500 normal control subjects. Functional analysis of the channel protein expressed in HEK293 cells by whole-cell patch clamp recording revealed that the N1366S mutation led to significant alterations in the gating process of the NaV1.4 channel. The N1366S mutant displayed a cold-induced hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and a depolarizing shift in fast inactivation, as well as a reduced rate of fast inactivation and accelerated recovery from fast inactivation. In addition, homology modelling and molecular dynamic simulation of N1366S and wild-type NaV1.4 channels indicated that the arginine-to-serine substitution disrupted the hydrogen bond formed between N1366 and R1454. Together, our results suggest that N1366S is a gain-of-function mutation of NaV1.4 at low temperature and the mutation may be responsible for the clinical symptoms of paramyotonia congenita in the affected family and constitute a basis for studies into its pathogenesis."}

Additionally, a gain-of-function mutation in CACNA1C is responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder Timothy syndrome that presents with prominent behavioral features on the autism spectrum. Given an emerging role for serotonin in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we investigate the relationship between Cav1.2 and the ascending serotonin system in the Timothy syndrome type 2 (TS2-neo) mouse, which displays behavioral features consistent with the core triad of ASD. We find that TS2-neo mice exhibit enhanced serotonin tissue content and axon innervation of the dorsal striatum, as well as decreased serotonin turnover in the amygdala. These regionally specific alterations are accompanied by an enhanced active coping response during acute stress (forced swim), serotonin neuron Fos activity in the caudal dorsal raphe, and serotonin type 1A receptor-dependent feedback inhibition of the rostral dorsal raphe nuclei. Collectively, these results suggest that the global gain-of-function Cav1.2 mutation associated with Timothy syndrome has pleiotropic effects on the ascending serotonin system including neuroanatomical changes, regional differences in forebrain serotonin metabolism and feedback regulatory control mechanisms within the dorsal raphe. Altered activity of the ascending serotonin system continues to emerge as a common neural signature across several ASD mouse models, and the capacity for Cav1.2 L-type calcium channels to impact both serotonin structure and function has important implications for several neuropsychiatric conditions."}

Loss-of-Function (LoF) variants in SETD5 are now considered a likely cause of ID. We report here a patient with a frameshift LoF variant in exon 12 of SETD5. This patient has features overlapping with other patients described with LoF SETD5 variants to include; similar facial morphology, feeding difficulties, ID, behavioral abnormalities and leg length discrepancy. In addition, he presents with an aberrant blind ending bronchus. This report adds to publications describing intragenic mutations in SETD5 and supports the assertion that de novo LoF mutations in SETD5 present with an overlapping but distinct phenotype in comparison with 3p25 microdeletion syndromes."}

KCNK3 encodes an acid-sensitive potassium channel, which contributes to the resting potential of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. KCNK3 is widely expressed in the body, and dimerizes with other KCNK3 subunits, or the closely related, acid-sensitive KCNK9 channel.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We engineered homomeric and heterodimeric mutant and nonmutant KCNK3 channels associated with PAH. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle and COS7 cell lines, we determined that homomeric and heterodimeric mutant channels in heterozygous KCNK3 conditions lead to mutation-specific severity of channel dysfunction. Both wildtype and mutant KCNK3 channels were activated by ONO-RS-082 (10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), causing cell hyperpolarization. We observed robust gene expression of KCNK3 in healthy and familial PAH patient lungs, but no quantifiable expression of KCNK9, and demonstrated in functional studies that KCNK9 minimizes the impact of select KCNK3 mutations when the 2 channel subunits co-assemble.\nCONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous KCNK3 mutations in PAH lead to variable loss of channel function via distinct mechanisms. Homomeric and heterodimeric mutant KCNK3 channels represent novel therapeutic substrates in PAH. Pharmacological and pH-dependent activation of wildtype and mutant KCNK3 channels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells leads to membrane hyperpolarization. Co-assembly of KCNK3 with KCNK9 subunits may provide protection against KCNK3 loss of function in tissues where both KCNK9 and KCNK3 are expressed, contributing to the lung-specific phenotype observed clinically in patients with PAH because of KCNK3 mutations."}

The apoC-III Gln38Lys variant was identified in subjects of Mexican origin with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. We postulated that Gln38Lys (C3QK), being a gain-of-function mutation, promotes hepatic VLDL1 assembly/secretion. To test this hypothesis, we expressed C3QK in McA-RH7777 cells and apoc3-null mice to contrast its effect with WT apoC-III (C3WT). In both model systems, C3QK expression increased the secretion of VLDL1-TAG (by 230%) under lipid-rich conditions. Metabolic labeling experiments with C3QK cells showed an increase in de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Fasting plasma concentration of TAG, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and FA were increased in C3QK mice as compared with C3WT mice. Liver of C3QK mice also displayed an increase in DNL and expression of lipogenic genes as compared with that in C3WT mice. These results suggest that C3QK variant is a gain-of-function mutation that can stimulate VLDL1 production, through enhanced DNL."}

A common coding variant of grainyhead like transcription factor 3 ( GRHL3) was recently shown to be associated with risk for CPO in Europeans. Mutations in this gene were also reported in families with Van der Woude syndrome. To identify rare mutations in GRHL3 that might explain the missing heritability for CPO, we sequenced GRHL3 in cases of CPO from Africa. We recruited participants from Ghana, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. This cohort included case-parent trios, cases and other family members, as well as controls. We sequenced exons of this gene in DNA from a total of 134 nonsyndromic cases. When possible, we sequenced them in parents to identify de novo mutations. Five novel mutations were identified: 2 missense (c.497C>A; p.Pro166His and c.1229A>G; p.Asp410Gly), 1 splice site (c.1282A>C p.Ser428Arg), 1 frameshift (c.470delC; p.Gly158Alafster55), and 1 nonsense (c.1677C>A; p.Tyr559Ter). These mutations were absent from 270 sequenced controls and from all public exome and whole genome databases, including the 1000 Genomes database (which includes data from Africa). However, 4 of the 5 mutations were present in unaffected mothers, indicating that their penetrance is incomplete. Interestingly, 1 mutation damaged a predicted sumoylation site, and another disrupted a predicted CK1 phosphorylation site. Overexpression assays in zebrafish and reporter assays in vitro indicated that 4 variants were functionally null or hypomorphic, while 1 was dominant negative. This study provides evidence that, as in Caucasian populations, mutations in GRHL3 contribute to the risk of nonsyndromic CPO in the African population."}

Moreover, recent findings indicate that Grn mutations are associated with other neurodegenerative disorders with tau pathology, including Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the influence of PGRN on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) accumulation, amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice were interbred with Grn-deficient mice, producing APP transgenic mice harboring the Grn hemizygote (APP/Grn+/-).

Current challenges are to dissect the molecular pathways underlying liver hepcidin synthesis in response to circulatory iron, HFE, TFR2, HJV, TMPRSS6 and BMP6 functions, and to define the major structural elements of hepcidin-ferroportin interaction. We built a first 3D model of human ferroportin structure, using the crystal structure of EmrD, a bacterial drug efflux transporter of the Major Facilitator Superfamily, as template. The model enabled study of disease-associated mutations, and guided mutagenesis experiments to determine the role of conserved residues in protein stability and iron transport. Results revealed novel amino acids that are critical for the iron export function and the hepcidin-mediated inhibition mechanism: for example, tryptophan 42, localized in the extracellular end of the ferroportin pore and involved in both biological functions. Here, we propose a strategy that is not limited to structure analysis, but integrates information from different sources, including human disease-associated mutations and functional in vitro assays. The first major hypothesis of this PhD thesis is that ferroportin resistance to hepcidin relies on different molecular mechanisms that are critical for ferroportin endocytosis, and include at least three fundamental steps: (i) hepcidin binding to ferroportin, (ii) structural reorganization of the N- and C-ter ferroportin lobes, and (iii) ferroportin ubiquitination."}

It is caused by haploinsufficiency of the TCF4 gene. The TCF4 protein has different functional domains, with the NLS (nuclear localization signal) domain coded by exons 7-8 and the bHLH (basic Helix-Loop-Helix) domain coded by exon 18. Several alternatively spliced TCF4 variants have been described, allowing for translation of variable protein isoforms. Typical PTHS patients have impairment of at least the bHLH domain. To which extent impairment of the remaining domains contributes to the final phenotype is not clear. There is recent evidence that certain loss-of-function variants disrupting TCF4 are associated with mild ID, but not with typical PTHS. We describe a frameshift-causing partial gene deletion encompassing exons 4-6 of TCF4 in an adult patient with mild ID and nonspecific facial dysmorphisms but without the typical features of PTHS, and a c.520C\u00a0>\u00a0T nonsense variant within exon 8 in a child presenting with a severe phenotype largely mimicking PTHS, but lacking the typical facial dysmorphism. Investigation on mRNA, along with literature review, led us to suggest a preliminary phenotypic map of loss-of-function variants affecting TCF4. An intragenic phenotypic map of loss-of-function variants in TCF4 is suggested here for the first time: variants within exons 1-4 and exons 4-6 give rise to a recurrent phenotype with mild ID not in the spectrum of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (biallelic preservation of both the NLS and bHLH domains); variants within exons 7-8 cause a severe phenotype resembling PTHS but in absence of the typical facial dysmorphism (impairment limited to the NLS domain); variants within exons 9-19 cause typical Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (impairment of at least the bHLH domain).

Yet these tumours harbour a number of alterations without obvious oncogenic function including BRAF-inactivating mutations. Inactivating BRAF mutants in lung predominate over the activating V600E mutant that is frequently observed in other tumour types. Here we demonstrate that the expression of an endogenous Braf(D631A) kinase-inactive isoform in mice (corresponding to the human BRAF(D594A) mutation) triggers lung adenocarcinoma in vivo, indicating that BRAF-inactivating mutations are initiating events in lung oncogenesis. Moreover, inactivating BRAF mutations have also been identified in a subset of KRAS-driven human lung tumours. Co-expression of Kras(G12V) and Braf(D631A) in mouse lung cells markedly enhances tumour initiation, a phenomenon mediated by Craf kinase activity, and effectively accelerates tumour progression when activated in advanced lung adenocarcinomas. We also report a key role for the wild-type Braf kinase in sustaining Kras(G12V)/Braf(D631A)-driven tumours. Ablation of the wild-type Braf allele prevents the development of lung adenocarcinoma by inducing a further increase in MAPK signalling that results in oncogenic toxicity; this effect can be abolished by pharmacological inhibition of Mek to restore tumour growth. However, the loss of wild-type Braf also induces transdifferentiation of club cells, which leads to the rapid development of lethal intrabronchiolar lesions. These observations indicate that the signal intensity of the MAPK pathway is a critical determinant not only in tumour development, but also in dictating the nature of the cancer-initiating cell and ultimately the resulting tumour phenotype."}

Its relevance is underscored by the identification of >500 mutations in KV7.1 and, at least, 36 in KCNE1, that cause Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). The aim of this study was to characterize the biophysical and cellular consequences of the D242N KV7.1 mutation associated with the LQTS. The mutation is located in the S4 transmembrane segment, within the voltage sensor of the KV7.1 channel, disrupting the conserved charge balance of this region. Perforated patch-clamp experiments show that, unexpectedly, the mutation did not disrupt the voltage-dependent activation but it removed the inactivation and slowed the activation kinetics of D242N KV7.1 channels. Biotinylation of cell-surface protein and co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that neither plasma membrane targeting nor co-assembly between KV7.1 and KCNE1 was altered by the mutation. However, the association of D242N KV7.1 with KCNE1 strongly shifted the voltage dependence of activation to more depolarized potentials (+50mV), hindering IKs current at physiologically relevant membrane potentials. Both functional and computational analysis suggest that the clinical phenotype of the LQTS patients carrying the D242N mutation is due to impaired action potential adaptation to exercise and, in particular, to increase in heart rate. Moreover, our data identify D242 aminoacidic position as a potential residue involved in the KCNE1-mediated regulation of the voltage dependence of activation of the KV7.1 channel."}

One such trigger may be an increase in cytosolic calcium, accompanying exercise. Many mixed syndromes mutants, including \u2206KPQ, E1784K, 1795insD and Q1909R, are found in calcium-sensitive regions. Elevated cytosolic calcium attenuates gain-of-function properties in \u2206KPQ, 1795insD and Q1909R, but not in E1784K. By contrast, elevated cytosolic calcium further exacerbates gain-of-function in E1784K by destabilizing slow inactivation. Action potential modelling, using a modified O'Hara Rudy model, suggests that elevated heart rate rescues action potential duration in \u2206KPQ, 1795insD and Q1909R, but not in E1784K.

Elevated cytosolic calcium, which is common during high heart rates, ameliorates or exacerbates the mixed syndrome phenotype depending on the genetic signature.\nABSTRACT: Inherited arrhythmias may arise from mutations in the gene for SCN5a, which encodes the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel, NaV 1.5. Mutants in NaV 1.5 result in Brugada Syndrome (BrS1), Long-QT Syndrome (LQT3) or mixed syndromes (an overlap of BrS1/LQT3). Exercise is a potential arrhythmogenic trigger in mixed syndromes. We aimed to determine the effects of elevated cytosolic calcium, which is common during exercise, in mixed syndrome NaV 1.5 mutants. We used whole-cell patch clamp to assess the biophysical properties of NaV 1.5 wild-type (WT), \u2206KPQ, E1784K, 1795insD and Q1909R mutants in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transiently transfected with the NaV 1.5 \u03b1 subunit (WT or mutants), \u03b21 subunit and enhanced green fluorescent protein. Voltage-dependence and kinetics were measured at cytosolic calcium levels of approximately 0, 500\u00a0and 2500\u00a0nm. In silico, action potential (AP) model simulations were performed using a modified O'Hara Rudy model. Elevated cytosolic calcium attenuates the late sodium current in \u2206KPQ, 1795insD and Q1909R, but not in E1784K. Elevated cytosolic calcium restores steady-state slow inactivation (SSSI) to the WT-form in Q1909R, but depolarized SSSI in E1784K. Our AP simulations showed a frequency-dependent reduction of AP duration in \u2206KPQ, 1795insD and Q1909R carriers. In E1784K, AP duration is relatively prolonged at both low and high heart rates, resulting in a sodium overload. Cellular perturbations during exercise may affect BrS1/LQT3 patients differently depending on their individual genetic signature.

LGMD has been clinically described in several breeds of dogs, but the responsible mutations are unknown. The clinical presentation in dogs is characterized by marked muscle weakness and atrophy in the shoulder and hips during puppyhood.\nMETHODS: Following clinical evaluation, the identification of the dystrophic histological phenotype on muscle histology, and demonstration of the absence of sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex by immunostaining, whole exome sequencing was performed on five Boston terriers: one affected dog and its three family members and one unrelated affected dog.\nRESULTS: Within sarcoglycan-\u03b4 (SGCD), a two base pair deletion segregating with LGMD in the family was discovered, and a deletion encompassing exons 7 and 8 was found in the unrelated dog. Both mutations are predicted to cause an absence of SGCD protein, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The mutations are private to each family.\nCONCLUSIONS: Here, we describe the first cases of canine LGMD characterized at the molecular level with the classification of LGMD2F."}

To investigate the role of FGFR2 in bone formation, we generated mice with tamoxifen-inducible expression of mutant FGFR2 (P253R) at the adult stage. Mechanical bone marrow ablation (BMX) was performed in both wild-type and Fgfr2 mutant (MT) mice. Changes in newly formed trabecular bone were assessed by micro-computed tomography and bone histomorphometry. We found that MT mice exhibited increased trabecular bone formation and decreased bone resorption after BMX accompanied with a remarkable increase in bone marrow stromal cell recruitment and proliferation, osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and enhanced Wnt/?-catenin activity. Furthermore, pharmacologically inhibiting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling can partially reverse the increased trabecular bone formation and decreased bone resorption in MT mice after BMX. Our data demonstrate that gain-of-function mutation in FGFR2 exerts a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-dependent anabolic effect on trabecular bone by promoting bone formation and inhibiting bone resorption at the adult stage.

Great progress has been made in elucidating the genetic aetiology of CHD with advances in genomic technology, which we leveraged in recovering a new pathway affecting heart development in humans previously known to affect heart development in an animal model.\nMETHODS: Four hundred and sixteen individuals from Thailand and the USA diagnosed with CHD and/or congenital diaphragmatic hernia were evaluated with chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing. The DECIPHER Consortium and medical literature were searched for additional patients. Murine hearts from ENU-induced mouse mutants and transgenic mice were evaluated using both episcopic confocal histopathology and troponin I stained sections.\nRESULTS: Loss of function ROBO1 variants were identified in three families; each proband had a ventricular septal defect, and one proband had tetralogy of Fallot. Additionally, a microdeletion in an individual with CHD was found in the medical literature. Mouse models showed perturbation of the Slit-Robo signalling pathway, causing septation and outflow tract defects and craniofacial anomalies. Two probands had variable facial features consistent with the mouse model.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings identify Slit-Robo as a significant pathway in human heart development and CHD."}

Human and mouse WNT10A mutant palmoplantar and tongue epithelia also display specific differentiation defects that are mimicked by loss of the transcription factor KLF4.

Herein we have systematically characterized two novel loss-of-function mutations in LPL from a Chinese family in which afflicted members were manifested by severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent pancreatitis. DNA sequencing revealed that the proband was a heterozygote carrying a novel c.T928C (p.C310R) mutation in exon 6 of the LPL gene. Another member of the family was detected to be a compound heterozygote who along with the c.T928C mutation also carried a novel missense mutation c.A1187T (p.E396V) in exon 8 of the LPL gene. Furthermore, COS-1 cells were transfected with lentiviruses containing the mutant LPL genes. While C310R markedly reduced the overall LPL protein level, COS-1 cells carrying E396V or double mutations contained similar overall LPL protein levels to the wild-type. The specific activity of the LPL mutants remained at comparable magnitude to the wild-type. However, few LPL were detected in the culture medium for the mutants, suggesting that both mutations caused aberrant triglyceride catabolism. More specifically, E396V and double mutations dampened the transport of LPL to the cell surface, while for the C310R mutation, reducing LPL protein level might be involved. By characterizing these two novel LPL mutations, this study has expanded our understanding on the pathogenesis of familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG)."}

We estimated the relationship of the PAI-1 risk allele with FEV1/FVC by multivariate linear regression, stratified by asthma status. We examined the association of the polymorphism with asthma and airway obstruction within asthmatics via multivariate logistic regression. We replicated associations in the SAPPHIRE cohort of African Americans (n=1056). Secondary analysis included the effect of the at-risk polymorphism on postbronchodilator lung function.\nRESULTS: There was an interaction between asthma status and the PAI-1 polymorphism on FEV1 /FVC (P=.03). The gain-of-function variants, genotypes (AA/AG), were associated with lower FEV1 /FVC in subjects with asthma (\u03b2=-1.25, CI: -2.14,-0.35, P=.006), but not in controls. Subjects with asthma and the AA/AG genotypes had a 5% decrease in FEV1 /FVC (P<.001). In asthmatics, the risk genotype (AA/AG) was associated with a 39% increase in risk of clinically relevant airway obstruction (OR=1.39, CI: 1.01, 1.92, P=.04). These associations persisted after exclusion of factors that increase PAI-1 including tobacco exposure and obesity.\nCONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The decrease in the FEV1 /FVC ratio associated with the risk genotype was modified by asthma status. The genotype increased the odds of airway obstruction by 75% within asthmatics only. As exposures known to increase PAI-1 levels did not mitigate this association, PAI-1 may contribute to airway obstruction in the context of chronic asthmatic airway inflammation."}

We evaluated temporal cerebellar expression profiles by RNA sequencing of ATXN2Q127 mice vs wildtype littermates. ATXN2Q127 mice are characterized by a progressive motor phenotype onset, and have progressive cerebellar molecular and neurophysiological (Purkinje cell firing frequency) phenotypes. Our analysis revealed previously uncharacterized early and progressive abnormal patterning of cerebellar gene expression. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed four gene modules that were significantly correlated with disease status, composed primarily of genes associated with GTPase signaling, calcium signaling, and cell death. Of these genes, few overlapped with differentially expressed cerebellar genes that we identified in Atxn2-/- knockout mice vs wildtype littermates, suggesting that loss-of-function is not a significant component of disease pathology.

It has recently been designated as a Fanconi anemia (FA) gene, following the discovery of two patients carrying dominant-negative mutations. FA is a hereditary DNA-repair disorder characterized by various congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and cancer predisposition. In this report, we describe a viable vertebrate model of RAD51 loss. Zebrafish rad51 loss-of-function mutants developed key features of FA, including hypocellular kidney marrow, sensitivity to cross-linking agents, and decreased size. We show that some of these symptoms stem from both decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of embryonic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Comutation of p53 was able to rescue the hematopoietic defects seen in the single mutants, but led to tumor development. We further demonstrate that prolonged inflammatory stress can exacerbate the hematological impairment, leading to an additional decrease in kidney marrow cell numbers. These findings strengthen the assignment of RAD51 as a Fanconi gene and provide more evidence for the notion that aberrant p53 signaling during embryogenesis leads to the hematological defects seen later in life in FA. Further research on this zebrafish FA model will lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of bone marrow failure in FA and the cellular role of RAD51."}

During this period, gefitinib was the only EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor reimbursed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance of Taiwan.\nRESULTS: The median progression-free survival and median OS were 11.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.7-14.2) and 26.9 months (21.2-32.5), respectively. The Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that postoperative recurrence, performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Grade [ECOG] \u22652), smoking index (\u226520 pack-years), liver metastasis at initial diagnosis, and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were independent prognostic factors for OS (hazard ratio [95% CI] 0.3 [0.11-0.83], p\u2009=\u2009.02; 2.69 [1.60-4.51], p\u2009<\u2009.001; 1.92 [1.24-2.97], p\u2009=\u2009.003; 2.26 [1.34-3.82], p\u2009=\u2009.002; 3.38 [1.85-7.78], p\u2009<\u2009.001, respectively).

Brain metastasis in the initial diagnosis or intracranial progression during gefitinib treatment is not a prognostic factor for OS.

In this study, we identify a subset of human melanomas that have loss-of-function mutations in ATR, a kinase that recognizes and repairs UV-induced DNA damage and is required for cellular proliferation. ATR mutant tumors exhibit both the accumulation of multiple mutations and the altered expression of inflammatory genes, resulting in decreased T\u00a0cell recruitment and increased recruitment of macrophages known to spur tumor invasion.

There are two classes of APDS: APDS1 that arises from p110\u03b4 mutations that are analogous to oncogenic mutations found in the broadly expressed p110\u03b1 subunit and APDS2 that occurs from a splice mutation resulting in p85\u03b1 with a central deletion (\u0394434-475). As p85 regulatory subunits associate with and inhibit all class IA catalytic subunits, APDS2 mutations are expected to similarly activate p110\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4, yet APDS2 largely phenocopies APDS1 without dramatic effects outside the immune system. We have examined the molecular mechanism of activation of both classes of APDS mutations using a combination of biochemical assays and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, we find that an APDS2 mutation in p85\u03b1 leads to substantial basal activation of p110\u03b4 (>300-fold) and disrupts inhibitory interactions from the nSH2, iSH2, and cSH2 domains of p85, whereas p110\u03b1 is only minimally basally activated (\u223c2-fold) when associated with mutated p85\u03b1. APDS1 mutations in p110\u03b4 (N334K, E525K, E1021K) mimic the activation mechanisms previously discovered for oncogenic mutations in p110\u03b1. All APDS mutations were potently inhibited by the Food and Drug Administration-approved p110\u03b4 inhibitor idelalisib. Our results define the molecular basis of how PIK3CD and PIK3R1 mutations result in APDS and reveal a potential path to treatment for all APDS patients."}

Previous work with SOD1 overexpression models supports a role for SOD1 toxic gain of function in ALS pathogenesis. However, the impact of SOD1 loss of function in ALS cannot be directly examined in overexpression models. In addition, overexpression may obscure the contribution of SOD1 loss of function in the degeneration of different neuronal populations. Here, we report the first single-copy, ALS knock-in models in C. elegans generated by transposon- or CRISPR/Cas9- mediated genome editing of the endogenous sod-1 gene. Introduction of ALS patient amino acid changes A4V, H71Y, L84V, G85R or G93A into the C. elegans sod-1 gene yielded single-copy/knock-in ALS SOD1 models. These differ from previously reported overexpression models in multiple assays. In single-copy/knock-in models, we observed differential impact of sod-1 ALS alleles on glutamatergic and cholinergic neurodegeneration. A4V, H71Y, G85R, and G93A animals showed increased SOD1 protein accumulation and oxidative stress induced degeneration, consistent with a toxic gain of function in cholinergic motor neurons. By contrast, H71Y, L84V, and G85R lead to glutamatergic neuron degeneration due to sod-1 loss of function after oxidative stress. However, dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal populations were spared in single-copy ALS models, suggesting a neuronal-subtype specificity previously not reported in invertebrate ALS SOD1 models. Combined, these results suggest that knock-in models may reproduce the neurotransmitter-type specificity of ALS and that both SOD1 loss and gain of toxic function differentially contribute to ALS pathogenesis in different neuronal populations."}
