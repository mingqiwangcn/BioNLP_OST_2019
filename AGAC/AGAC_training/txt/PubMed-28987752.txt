Three Cases of KCNT1 Mutations: Malignant Migrating Partial Seizures in Infancy with Massive Systemic to Pulmonary Collateral Arteries.
KCNT1 mutations are gain-of-function mutations in potassium channels resulting in severe infantile epilepsy. Herein we describe 3 infants with malignant migrating partial seizures with KCNT1 mutations accompanied by massive systemic to pulmonary collateral arteries with life-threatening hemoptysis and heart failure.
