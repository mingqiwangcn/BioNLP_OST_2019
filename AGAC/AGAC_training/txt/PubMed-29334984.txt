New insights into ANGPLT3 in controlling lipoprotein metabolism and risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Dyslipidemia, characterized by elevation of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and reduction of plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), has been verified as a causal risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), leading to a high mortality rate in general population. It is important to understand the molecular metabolism underlying dyslipidemia in order to reduce the risk and to develop effective therapeutic approaches against CVD. ANGPTL3 (human) or Angptl3 (mouse), one member of the angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) family, has been identified as an important regulator of lipid metabolism by inhibiting LPL and EL activity. Results have demonstrated that inactivation of Angptl3 in mice could obviously reduce the level of TG, LDL-C and the atherosclerotic lesion size, leading to a lower risk for dyslipidemia and CVD. Additionally, in humans, carriers with homozygous LOF mutations in ANGPTL3 have lower plasma LDL-C, TG levels and lower risk of atherosclerosis compared to the non-carriers. Here, we collect the latest data and results, giving a new insight into the important role of ANGPTL3 in controlling lipoprotein metabolism. Finally, we introduce two update reports on the antisense oligonucleotide and monoclonal antibody-based inactivation of ANGPTL3 in human clinical trials, to identify that ANGPTL3 could be a novel and effective target for the treatment of dyslipidemia and CVD.
