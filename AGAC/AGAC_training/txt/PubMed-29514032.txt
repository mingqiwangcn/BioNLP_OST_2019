A Gain-of-Function Mutation in EPO in Familial Erythrocytosis.
Familial erythrocytosis with elevated erythropoietin levels is frequently caused by mutations in genes that regulate oxygen-dependent transcription of the gene encoding erythropoietin ( EPO). We identified a mutation in EPO that cosegregated with disease with a logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.3 in a family with autosomal dominant erythrocytosis. This mutation, a single-nucleotide deletion (c.32delG), introduces a frameshift in exon 2 that interrupts translation of the main EPO messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript but initiates excess production of erythropoietin from what is normally a noncoding EPO mRNA transcribed from an alternative promoter located in intron 1.
