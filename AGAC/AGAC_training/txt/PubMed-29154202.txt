Polymorphisms in inflammasome genes and risk of asthma in Brazilian children.
Considering its role in inflammation and recently described "alternative" roles in epithelial homeostasis and Th1/Th2 balance, we hypothesize that inflammasome genetics could contribute to the development of asthma. Selected functional polymorphisms in inflammasome genes are evaluated in a cohort of asthmatic children and their families. Gain-of-function NLRP1 variants rs11651270, rs12150220 and rs2670660 resulted significantly associated to asthma in trios (TDT) analysis; and rs11651270 and rs2670660 also with asthma severity and total IgE level in asthmatic children. NLRP1 activators in humans are still unknown, however we hypothesized that individuals with gain-of-function SNPs in NLRP1 could be more prone in activating inflammasome in the presence of asthma-related cell stressors (i.e. ER stress or ROS), and this activation contribute to exacerbate inflammatory response and asthma development. Gain-of-function IL1A rs17561 resulted significantly associated with a reduced pulmonary capacity in asthmatic children. IL18 rs5744256 which lead to lower serum level of IL-18 appeared to be associated to a worse response to bronchodilators. Concluding, this work provides evidences about the contribution of inflammasome genetics in the development of paediatric asthma, both considering its inflammatory role in alveolar macrophages (i.e.: NLRP1) or its homeostatic role in lung epithelial cells (i.e.: IL1A, IL18).
