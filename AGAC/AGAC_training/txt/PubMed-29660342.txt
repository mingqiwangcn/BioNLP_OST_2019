Investigation of TRPV1 loss-of-function phenotypes in TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis.
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) random mutagenesis was used to generate a mouse model for the analysis of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) cation channel. A transversion from T→A in exon 4 led to a Leu206Stop mutation generating a loss-of-function mutant. The TRPV1 agonist capsaicin was used to analyze functional and nociceptive parameters in vitro and in vivo in TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice and congenic C3HeB/FeJ controls. Capsaicin-induced [Ca2+]i changes in small diameter DRG neurons were significantly diminished in TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice and administration of capsaicin induced neither hypothermia nor nocifensive behaviour in vivo. TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice were tested in the spinal nerve ligation of mononeuropathic pain and developed mechanical hypersensitivity two weeks after nerve injury. In the open field test, a significant increase in spontaneous locomotion was detected in TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice as compared to wildtype controls. TRPV1 knockout mice have been reported to carry a similar phenotype regarding capsaicin-evoked responses in vitro and in vivo. However, in contrast to TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice, TRPV1 knockout mice did not differ in spontaneous locomotion as compared to congenic C57BL/6 mice, suggesting subtle ENU-dependent or independent strain differences between TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice and their wildtype controls. In summary, these data revealed a target-related (i.e. capsaicin-evoked) phenotype of TRPV1 Leu206Stop mice closely resembling that of published TRPV1 knockout mice. However, since ENU-mutant mice are congenic with the mouse strain initially used in random mutagenesis, direct phenotypic comparison with the respective wildtype controls is possible, and the time-consuming backcrossing in lines with targeted mutations is avoided.
