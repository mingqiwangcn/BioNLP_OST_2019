HDX-MS reveals dysregulated checkpoints that compromise discrimination against self RNA during RIG-I mediated autoimmunity.
Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) ensures immune surveillance of viral RNAs bearing a 5'-triphosphate (5'ppp) moiety. Mutations in RIG-I (C268F and E373A) lead to impaired ATPase activity, thereby driving hyperactive signaling associated with autoimmune diseases. Here we report, using hydrogen/deuterium exchange, mechanistic models for dysregulated RIG-I proofreading that ultimately result in the improper recognition of cellular RNAs bearing 7-methylguanosine and N1-2'-O-methylation (Cap1) on the 5' end. Cap1-RNA compromises its ability to stabilize RIG-I helicase and blunts caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) partial opening by threefold. RIG-I H830A mutation restores Cap1-helicase engagement as well as CARDs partial opening event to a level comparable to that of 5'ppp. However, E373A RIG-I locks the receptor in an ATP-bound state, resulting in enhanced Cap1-helicase engagement and a sequential CARDs stimulation. C268F mutation renders a more tethered ring architecture and results in constitutive CARDs signaling in an ATP-independent manner.
