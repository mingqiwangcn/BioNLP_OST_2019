Here we describe how deficiency of CYBC1, a previously uncharacterized protein in humans (C17orf62), leads to reduced expression of NADPH oxidase's main subunit (gp91phox) and results in CGD. Analyzing two brothers diagnosed with CGD we identify a homozygous loss-of-function mutation, p.Tyr2Ter, in CYBC1. Imputation of p.Tyr2Ter into 155K chip-genotyped Icelanders reveals six additional homozygotes, all with signs of CGD, manifesting as colitis, rare infections, or a severely impaired PMA-induced neutrophil oxidative burst. Homozygosity for p.Tyr2Ter consequently associates with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Iceland (P\u2009=\u20098.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8; OR\u2009=\u200967.6), as well as reduced height (P\u2009=\u20093.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4; -8.5\u2009cm). Overall, we find that CYBC1 deficiency results in CGD characterized by colitis and a distinct profile of infections indicative of macrophage dysfunction.","project":"AGAC_training","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":29},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":30,"end":38},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":50,"end":55},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":74,"end":103},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":105,"end":114},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":199,"end":204},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":205,"end":234},"obj":"Disease"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":536,"end":552},"obj":"NegReg"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":563,"end":572},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":577,"end":582},"obj":"Gene"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":824,"end":833},"obj":"Var"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":847,"end":862},"obj":"Reg"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":863,"end":889},"obj":"Disease"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R13","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R14","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R15","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T12","obj":"T10"},{"id":"R16","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R17","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R2","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T2","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"CauseOf","subj":"T6","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R7","pred":"ThemeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"}]}
