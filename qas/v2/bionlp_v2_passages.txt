There are numerous examples of genetic redundancy and complex regulatory interactions among plant MADS-box genes (for a review, see Gutierrez-Cortines and Davies, 2000). However,  [CLS] CBF2 is repressed, although not as drastically as in seeds, in seedlings constitutively expressing AGL15 relative to wild-type [CLS]  plants, and is induced in seedlings accumulating the AGL15-VP16 fusion protein (Figure 5a). In support of this observation, we have performed crosses between plants carrying a GUS reporter gene", " from the embryo proper to the presumptive hypophysis and contributes to hypophysis\nspecification (Friml et al. 2003; Aida et al. 2004; Weijers et al. 2006). Because the auxin signaling-responsive  [CLS] DR5rev promoter fused to GFP (DR5rev\u2237GFP) is specifically active in the hypophysis cells of wild-type [CLS]  globular embryos (Friml et al. 2003), and hypophysis specification is perturbed in dcl1 embryos, we examined the activity of DR5rev\u2237GFP in dcl1-5 embryos to test whether DCL1 was required", " the timing of the different components of the\nprogram seems to be unaffected. In particular, we still see accumulation of chlorophyll preceding the expression of the seed\nstorage protein  [CLS] At2S3, as in wild-type [CLS]  embryos. It is tempting to speculate that miRNAs regulate the initiation, but not the progression, of maturation.\n"]]
