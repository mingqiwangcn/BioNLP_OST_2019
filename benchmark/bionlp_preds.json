Structural dysfunction of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR is associated with the clinical response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with NSCLC. The most common EGFR gene mutations occur as either deletions in exon 19 or as substitution L858R in exon 21 and cause a clinically beneficial response to gefinitib or erlotinib treatment. Unfortunately, the majority of patients finally develop resistance to these drugs. Acquired resistance is linked to secondary mutations localised in the EGFR gene,", "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations are frequent in lung cancer arising in patients of Asian ethnicity, female sex, nonsmokers, and adenocarcinoma histology. About 70% of the patients with EGFR mutations respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including gefitinib and erlotinib, whereas only 10% of those without the mutations do so. Therefore, EGFR mutation is being recognized as one of the most reliable predictive factors for treatment using EGFR-TKIs. Another important issue in clinical practice is the fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) that can develop in patients with gefitinib treatment, especially Asian patients.

In the recent past, polymorphisms in the PAI-1 gene have been identified and their impact on PAI-1 expression has been characterized. This article will review the current knowledge of these PAI-1 gene polymorphisms (in cell culture epidemiological, and clinical studies) and their role in the development of cardiovascular disease.", "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease.

Polymerase chain reaction-amplified 1106-bp fragments of the promoter of the 1/1 and 2/2 PAI-1 genotypes were sequenced and showed 5 regions of small nucleotide differences in the 1/1 versus 2/2 PAI-1 promoters that consistently occurred with high frequency.", "and localization of ECM components.

The expression of both collagen type I and III were reduced. Interestingly, no difference in protease activity could be ascertained as cause of the decreased ECM accumulation.

In addition, A. halleri was found to be more tolerant to the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea than A. thaliana. Since PDF1s are known to be promiscuous antifungal proteins able to convey zinc tolerance, we propose, on the basis of the findings of this study, that high constitutive PDF1 transcript accumulation in A. halleri is a potential way to skip the JA signaling activation step required to increase the PDF1 transcript level in the A. thaliana", "The Arabidopsis thaliana PROTODERMAL FACTOR1 (PDF1) gene encoding a putative extracellular proline-rich protein is exclusively expressed in the L1 layer of shoot apices and the protoderm of organ primordia.

Our findings suggest that dsRNAs represent genuine PAMPs in plants, which induce a signaling cascade involving SERK1 and a specific dsRNA receptor.

Recessive mutations in the Arabidopsis PICKLE (PKL) gene also induce somatic embryogenesis in postgerminative roots cultured on hormone-free medium (40). However, LEC1 is expressed in the roots of pkl mutant but not wild-type seedlings (41). This result suggests that the chromodomain protein PKL acts normally to repress LEC1 in postgerminative roots, and therefore that LEC1, at least in part, mediates somatic embryo formation in pkl mutants. Given our results, we hypothesize that LEC2 may also be derepressed in pkl mutants. The ability of LEC2 and", "RT-PCR and RNA-seq assays showed that expression of the LEAFY gene (LFY) and a number of LFY-regulated floral homeotic genes were down-regulated in seedlings of the pkl mutants. As predicted, overexpression of LFY restored normal flowering time of pkl mutants. Our results suggest that PKL may be involved in regulating flowering time via LFY expression. To uncover the underlying mechanism, ChIP-PCR using anti-PKL was performed on materials from three developmental stages of seedlings. Our results showed that PKL associated with the genomic sequences of LFY, particularly at 10-day and 25-day after germination.

During reproductive development, auxin specifies the site of flower initiation and subsequently regulates organ growth and patterning as well as later events that determine reproductive success. Underlying auxin action in plant tissues is its uneven distribution, resulting in groups of cells with high auxin levels (auxin maxima) or graded distributions of the hormone (auxin gradients). Dynamic auxin distribution within the periphery of the inflorescence meristems specifies the site of floral meristem initiation, while auxin maxima present at the tips of developing floral organ primordia probably mediate organ", "The plant hormone auxin is essential for plant growth and development, controlling both organ development and overall plant architecture. Auxin homeostasis is regulated by coordination of biosynthesis, transport, conjugation, sequestration/storage, and catabolism to optimize concentration-dependent growth responses and adaptive responses to temperature, water stress, herbivory, and pathogens. At present, the best defined pathway of auxin biosynthesis is the TAA/YUC route, in which the tryptophan aminotransferases TAA and TAR and YUCCA flavin-dependent monooxygenases produce the auxin indole-3-acetic acid from tryptophan.

The strong expression of WRI1 specifically detected at the onset of the maturation phase in oil-accumulating tissues of A. thaliana seeds is fully consistent with this function. Complementation experiments carried out with various seed-specific promoters emphasized the importance of a tight regulation of WRI1 expression for proper oil accumulation, raising the question of the factors controlling WRI1 transcription. Interestingly, molecular and genetic analyses using an inducible system demonstrated that WRI1 is a target of LEAFY COTYLEDON2 and is necessary for", "The WRINKLED1 (WRI1) transcription factor has been shown to play a role of the utmost importance during oil accumulation in maturing seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little is known about the regulatory processes involved. In this paper, comprehensive functional analyses of three new mutants corresponding to null alleles of wri1 confirm that the induction of WRI1 is a prerequisite for fatty acid synthesis and is important for normal embryo development.

It is noteworthy that the fine characterization of the changes in mRNA accumulation for BCCP2, PKp-\u03b21 and WRI1 throughout silique development shows that the induction of the regulatory factor precedes the induction of its targets in the Col-0 accession (Figure 3). This slight delay in the detection of mRNAs corresponding to target genes of WRI1 may presumably illustrate biochemical processes occurring in embryo cells, such as translation of the WRI1 peptide, and post-translational regulations (e.g. translocation of WRI1 towards", "Many plant species produce and build up triacylglycerol (TAG) in their seeds as a main resource to provide carbon and energy during seedling development. Plant seed oils are important not only for human diets but also as renewable feedstock of industrial uses. WRINKLED1 (WRI1), an APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor, plays an essential role in the transcriptional regulation of TAG biosynthesis as WRI1 regulates the expression of key genes in the glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. Recent work has identified intrinsic structural disorder in WRI1 that may affect the stability of the protein.
