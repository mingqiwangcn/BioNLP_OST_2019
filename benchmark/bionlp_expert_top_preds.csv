It is known that the B3 domain of VP1, when taken out of its native context, binds in vitro to the DNA element TCCATGCAT (Suzuki et al. 1997). It is likely, therefore, that the B3 domain of FUS3 similarly mediates binding to specific promoter sequences (Bäumlein et al. 1994). The same applies to ABI3 (Nambara et al. 1995 ;Parcy et al. 1994). During embryogenesis the FUS3 transcript becomes detectable 2 d.a.p. paralleled by the appearance of the ABI3 mRNA. The finding of co-expression at differing levels, however, is consistent with the fact that",embryogenesis,
