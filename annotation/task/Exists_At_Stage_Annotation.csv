Q1-1,seedev_train_965,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,LEC1,Development_Phase,"LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), an atypical subunit of the nuclear transcription factor Y (NF-Y) CCAAT-binding transcription factor, is a central regulator that controls many aspects of seed development including the maturation phase during which seeds accumulate storage macromolecules and embryos acquire the ability to withstand desiccation. To define the gene networks and developmental processes controlled by LEC1, genes regulated directly by and downstream of LEC1 were identified. We compared the mRNA profiles of wild-type and lec1-null mutant seeds at several stages of development to define genes that are down-regulated or up-regulated by the lec1 mutation. We used ChIP and differential gene-expression analyses in Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing LEC1 and in developing Arabidopsis and soybean seeds to identify globally the target genes that are transcriptionally regulated by LEC1 in planta Collectively, our results show that LEC1 controls distinct gene sets at different developmental stages, including those that mediate the temporal transition between photosynthesis and chloroplast biogenesis early in seed development and seed maturation late in development. Analyses of enriched DNA sequence motifs that may act as cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of LEC1 target genes suggest that LEC1 may interact with other transcription factors to regulate distinct gene sets at different stages of seed development.",maturation phase,Yes,
Q1-2,seedev_train_965,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,LEC1,Development_Phase,"The LAFL transcription factors LEC2, ABI3, FUS3 and LEC1 are master regulators of seed development. LEC2, ABI3 and FUS3 are closely related proteins that contain a B3-type DNA binding domain. We have previously shown that LEC1 (a NF-YB type protein) can increase LEC2 and ABI3 but not FUS3 activity. Interestingly, FUS3, LEC2 and ABI3 contain a B2 domain, the function of which remains elusive. We showed that LEC1 and LEC2 partially co-localised in the nucleus of developing embryos. By comparing protein sequences from various species, we identified within the B2 domains a set of highly conserved residues (i.e. TKxxARxxRxxAxxR). This domain directly interacts with LEC1 in yeast. Mutations of the conserved amino acids of the motif in the B2 domain abolished this interaction both in yeast and in moss protoplasts and did not alter the nuclear localisation of LEC2 in planta. Conversely, the mutations of key amino acids for the function of LEC1 in planta (D86K) prevented the interaction with LEC2.",seed development,Yes,
Q1-3,seedev_train_965,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,LEC1,Development_Phase,"The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) gene is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. We isolated the LEC1 gene and showed that it functions at an early developmental stage to maintain embryonic cell fate. The LEC1 gene encodes a transcription factor homolog, the CCAAT box-binding factor HAP3 subunit. LEC1 RNA accumulates only during seed development in embryo cell types and in endosperm tissue. Ectopic postembryonic expression of the LEC1 gene in vegetative cells induces the expression of embryo-specific genes and initiates formation of embryo-like structures. Our results suggest that LEC1 is an important regulator of embryo development that activates the transcription of genes required for both embryo morphogenesis and cellular differentiation.",early developmental stage,Yes,

Q1-5,seedev_train_965,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,LEC1,Development_Phase,"The anatomy of lec1 mutant cotyledons is intermediate between those of a wild-type cotyledon and a leaf (West et al. 1994). Finally, LEC1 appears to act only during embryo development. Desiccation-intolerant lec1 embryos can be rescued from plants before desiccation and germinated to produce homozygous mutant plants that are fertile and that do not display any obvious vegetative or floral mutant phenotypes ([28] and [53]). Two other LEC class genes, LEC2 and FUSCA3 (FUS3), are thought to share similar or overlapping functions with LEC1, including the specification or cotyledon identity and the maintenance of maturation ([2], [18] and [29]). Although nothing has been reported about how LEC class genes act at the molecular level, their involvement in many diverse aspects of embryogenesis suggests that these genes serve as regulators of higher plant embryonic processes.Figure 1. Pleiotropic Effects of the lec1 Mutation on Embryo DevelopmentMajor differences between wild-type and lec1 mutant embryos are as follows. Embryo shape: the axes of mutant embryos are short, and their cotyledons are round and do not curl. Anthocyanin generally accumulates at the tips of mutant cotyledons.",embryo development,Yes,
Q2-1,seedev_train_971,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,FUS3 transcript,Development_Phase,"The transcription factor FUSCA3 (FUS3) controls the transition from the embryonic to the vegetative phase of development by regulating abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. In a feedback loop, FUS3 accumulation is negatively and positively regulated by GA and ABA, respectively, by an uncharacterized mechanism. Here, we use a FUS3-GFP construct to show that the level of the FUS3 protein decreases dramatically during mid to late embryogenesis, whereas its mRNA is present at a high level. Deletion studies identify a C-terminal domain (CTD) that negatively regulates mRNA and protein levels, and mediates sensitivity to ABA and GA. Indeed, a CTD-truncated FUS3 variant accumulates at high level, and is insensitive to the destabilizing and stabilizing effects of GA and ABA, respectively. In contrast, fusion of various fragments of the CTD with GFP is sufficient to greatly reduce GFP fluorescence. The GFP-CTD fluorescence can be increased by ABA and paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis. Cell-free degradation assays show that FUS3 is a short-lived protein.",vegetative,No,"The presence of the RNA during vegetative phase is unclear from this paragraph. However, the paragraph makes clear that the mRNA is at high level during mid and late embryogenesis which is the most correct answer found here."
Q2-2,seedev_train_971,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,FUS3 transcript,Development_Phase,"Conditionally lethal mutant alleles of the FUSCA3 (FUS3) gene of Arabidopsis thaliana are specifically defective in the gene expression program responsible for seed maturation. FUS3 was isolated by map-based cloning and expression of the FUS3 cDNA resulted in complementation of the Fus3- phenotype. In the predicted FUS3 gene product, a continuous stretch of more than 100 amino acids shows significant sequence similarity to the B3 domains of the polypeptides encoded by ABI3 (Arabidopsis) and VP1 (maize). FUS3 transcription was detected mainly in siliques and was found to be developmentally regulated during embryogenesis. Transcripts of abnormal sizes were observed in fus3 mutants due to aberrant splicing caused by point mutations at intron termini. Sequence analysis of mutant and wild-type FUS3 alleles, as well as sequencing of fus3 cDNAs, revealed small inframe deletions at two different sites of the coding region. While a deletion between B3 and the C-terminus of the predicted polypeptide was found in conjunction with normal FUS3 function, another deletion located within the conserved B3 domain (as well as truncations therein) were associated with the Fus3- phenotype.",embryogenesis,Yes,
Q2-3,seedev_train_971,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,FUS3 transcript,Development_Phase,"We also showed that immature fus3 siliques accumulated one-third of the wild-type level of abscisic acid (ABA), but mature fus3 siliques accumulated ABA at a level comparable to that in the wild type. The possible mechanisms of controlling developmental timing in late embryo development as well as collaborative and distinct roles of ABI3 and FUS3 are discussed.",late embryo development,No,"This answer appears to be correct from previous paragraphs but is not clear from this one.

Q2-4,seedev_train_971,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,FUS3 transcript,Development_Phase,"Arabidopsis abi3 and fus3 mutants are defective in late embryo development and their embryos show precocious growth. To understand the function and role of ABI3 and FUS3, we analyzed expression patterns of genes which were normally activated during late embryo development and germination in these mutants. Using the differential display method, both upregulated and downregulated genes were observed in immature siliques of the abi3 fus3 double mutant. Four clones having more abundant expression in the abi3 fus3 double mutant than in wild type were isolated. These genes were activated during wild-type germination, suggesting that some genes that are activated during wild-type germination are precociously activated in the abi3 fus3 mutant during late embryo development. Also, genes that were activated during wild-type germination were isolated and their expression patterns during late embryo development in the wild type and in abi3, fus3, and abi3 fus3 mutants were analyzed. Sixteen such clones were found, and 11 of these showed derepression or precocious activation of gene expression in the mutants. These results indicate that ABI3 and FUS3 negatively regulate a particular set of genes during late embryo development.",late embryo development,No,"This answer appears to be correct from previous paragraphs but is not clear from this one.

From these data, we suggest that LEC1 controls the expression of the SSP genes in a hierarchical manner, which involves ABI3 and FUS3.",LEC1-induced ectopic,No,"Object is referring to expression of a different gene, not that of the desired subject."
Q3-1,seedev_train_77,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,AGL15,Development_Phase,"AGAMOUS-like-15 (AGL15) is a member of the MADS-domain family of DNA-binding regulatory factors that accumulates preferentially in tissue developing in an embryonic mode. To better understand how AGL15 functions, we developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach to isolate genes regulated directly by AGL15. ChIP allows purification of in vivo protein-DNA complexes. The co-purified DNA is recovered and used to isolate the putatively regulated gene. Several tests must be performed to show that the putative downstream target gene is truly regulated by the DNA-binding protein. The DNA-binding regulatory protein must interact with cis regulatory elements. The downstream gene expression pattern should respond to the level of the trans-acting regulatory factor. The cis element should be able to confer regulation in response to the trans-acting factor. We describe, in this report, our ChIP protocol, and discuss in detail, tests to confirm regulation by AGL15 for two targets identified by ChIP. These targets are referred to as Downstream Target of AGL15 (DTA1 and DTA2). Expression of DTA1, which encodes a protein with high similarity to GA-2 oxidase-like proteins, is induced by AGL15. DTA2 encodes a novel protein and expression of this target is repressed by AGL15.",embryonic,Yes,
Q3-2,seedev_train_77,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,AGL15,Development_Phase,"AGL15 (for AGAMOUS-like 15) is currently the only reported member of the plant MADS domain family of transcriptional regulators that preferentially accumulates during embryo development. Additionally, AGL15 is one of the more divergent members of the MADS domain family, including within the DNA-binding domain. Previous studies have shown that MADS domain proteins bind to DNA sequences with an overall consensus of CC(A/T)6GG (called a CArG motif). Nonetheless, different MADS domain proteins exhibit similar yet distinct binding site preferences that may be critical for differential gene regulation. To determine the consensus sequence preferentially bound by AGL15 in vitro, PCR-assisted binding site selection assays were performed. AGL15 was observed to prefer a CArG motif with a longer A/T-rich core and is to date the only plant MADS domain protein having such a preference. Next, the Arabidopsis genome data base was searched for genes containing AGL15 binding sites as candidates for direct regulation by AGL15. One gene, DTA4 (for Downstream Target of AGL15-4), was identified by this method, and then confirmed as a direct target of AGL15 in vivo.",embryo development,Yes,
Q3-3,seedev_train_77,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,AGL15,Development_Phase,"Although small amounts of AGL15 protein might accumulate in these tissues throughout the vegetative phase, we conclude that the amounts of nuclear-localized AGL15 protein approach those seen in young embryos only during the earliest stages of vegetative growth in the shoot apex of Arabidopsis. With the onset of the reproductive phase, AGL15 promoter activity ceases in the meristematic cells at the apex of the inflorescence. This pattern of gene regulation further distinguishes AGL15 from the large group of floral MADS box genes, including AP1 (Mandel et al. 1992b) and FRUITFULL/AGL8 (Mandel and Yanofsky 1995a ; Gu et al. 1998), which are preferentially expressed during the reproductive phase and are induced or upregulated during the transition to flowering (Hempel et al. 1997). In terms of regulation, AGL15 is most similar to the MADS box gene FLOWERING LOCUS C, which encodes a repressor of flowering and is also downregulated in the transition to flowering (Michaels and Amasino 1999). During the reproductive phase, AGL15 promoter activity is also associated with young immature cells. Cell maturation proceeds in the apical-to-basal direction in floral organs, as it does in leaves (reviewed in Telfer and Poethig 1994).",vegetative phase,Yes,"The previous answers were more correct and likely more relevant. AGL 15 is found less in the vegetative phase than embryonic phase, where it is at high levels. However, this answer is correct."
Q3-4,seedev_train_77,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,AGL15,Development_Phase,"When directed to regulatory regions of genes, SAP18 or other components of the HDAC complex lead to repression of gene expression (Song and Galbraith, 2006; Song et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2000; Yang et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 2001). We demonstrated that SAP18 is able to associate with DNA-bound AGL15 in vitro, but is not able to directly interact with a strong AGL15 binding site (Figure 7). Likewise, SAP18 also interacts with DNA-bound ERF3 in vitro, but not with the ERF3 binding site (Song and Galbraith, 2006).",vitro,No,vitro is not a development phase.
Q3-5,seedev_train_77,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,AGL15,Development_Phase,"AGL15 (AGAMOUS-like 15), a member of the MADS-domain family of regulatory factors, accumulates preferentially in the organs and tissues derived from double fertilization in flowering plants (i.e. the embryo, suspensor, and endosperm). The developmental role of AGL15 is still undefined. If it is involved in embryogenesis rather than some other aspect of seed biology, then AGL15 protein should accumulate whenever development proceeds in the embryonic mode, regardless of the origin of those embryos or their developmental context. To test this, we used AGL15-specific antibodies to analyze apomictic embryogenesis in dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), microspore embryogenesis in oilseed rape (Brassica napus), and somatic embryogenesis in alfalfa (Medicago sativa). In every case, AGL15 accumulated to relatively high levels in the nuclei of the embryos. AGL15 also accumulated in cotyledon-like organs produced by the xtc2 (extra cotyledon2) mutant of Arabidopsis and during precocious germination in oilseed rape. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of AGL15 appeared to be developmentally regulated in all embryogenic situations.",embryonic mode,Yes,"In this paragraph, ""embryogenesis"" would be equally correct."
Q4-1,seedev_train_186,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,LEC1 RNAs,Development_Phase,"What is more, LEC1 (a homolog of the NF-YB subunit of the CCAAT-binding complex) further enhanced the activation of this target promoter in the presence of LEC2 and ABI3. Finally, recombinant LEC1 and LEC2 proteins produced in Arabidopsis protoplasts could form a ternary complex with NF-YC2 in vitro, providing a molecular explanation for their functional interactions. Taken together, these results allow us to propose a molecular model for the transcriptional regulation of seed genes by the L-AFL proteins, based on the formation of regulatory multiprotein complexes between NF-YBs, which carry a specific aspartate-55 residue, and B3 transcription factors.",,Yes,This paragraph discusses LEC1 proteins but not RNAs.
Q4-2,seedev_train_186,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,LEC1 RNAs,Development_Phase,"Arabidopsis transcriptional factors LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2), FUSCA3 (FUS3), ABSCISIC ACID3 (ABI3), and ABSCISIC ACID5 (ABI5) are known to regulate multiple aspects of seed development. In an attempt to understand the developmental control of storage product accumulation, we observed the expression time course of the five transcripts. The sequential expression of these factors during seed fill suggests differentiation of their normal responsibilities. By extending the expression periods of the two early genes LEC1 and LEC2 in transgenic seeds, we demonstrated that the subsequent timing of FUS3, ABI3, and ABI5 transcripts depends on LEC1 and LEC2. Because a delayed onset or reduced level of FUS3 mRNA coincided with reduction of seed oil content in the transgenic seeds, the role of FUS3 in oil deposition was further examined. Analysis of published seed transcriptome data indicated that FUS3 transcript increased together with nearly all the plastidial fatty acid biosynthetic transcripts during development.",,Yes,
Q4-3,seedev_train_186,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,LEC1 RNAs,Development_Phase,"The transition between seed and seedling phases of development is coordinated by an interaction between the closely related ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), FUSCA3 (FUS3), and LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2; AFL) and VIVIPAROUS1/ABI3-LIKE (VAL) clades of the B3 transcription factor family that respectively activate and repress the seed maturation program. In the val1 val2 double mutant, derepression of the LEC1, LEC1-LIKE (L1L), and AFL (LAFL) network is associated with misexpression of embryonic characteristics resulting in arrested seedling development. We show that while the frequency of the embryonic fate in val1 val2 seedlings depends on the developmental timing of seed rescue, VAL proteins repress LAFL genes during germination, but not during seed development. Quantitative analysis of LAFL mutants that suppress the val1 val2 seedling phenotype revealed distinct roles of LAFL genes in promoting activation of the LAFL network. LEC2 and FUS3 are both essential for coordinate activation of the network, whereas effects of LEC1, L1L, and ABI3 are additive.",,Yes,This paragraph discusses LEC1 proteins but not RNAs.
Q4-4,seedev_train_186,Exists_At_Stage,RNA,LEC1 RNAs,Development_Phase,"Progression through embryogenesis and the transition to germination is subject to regulation by many transcription factors, including those encoded by the Arabidopsis LEC1 (LEAFY COTYLEDON1), FUS3 (FUSCA3), and abscisic acid-insensitive (ABI) ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5 loci. To determine whether the ABI4, ABI5, LEC1, and FUS3 loci interact or act independently, we analyzed abi fus3 and abi lec1 double mutants. Our results show that both ABI4 and ABI5 interact genetically with both LEC1 and FUS3 in controlling pigment accumulation, suppression of vivipary, germination sensitivity to abscisic acid, gene expression during mid- and late embryogenesis, sugar metabolism, sensitivity to sugar, and etiolated growth. However, the relative strengths of the observed interactions vary among responses and may even be antagonistic. Furthermore, the interactions reveal cryptic effects of individual loci that are not detectable by analyses of single mutants. Despite these strong genetic interactions, but consistent with the disparities in peak expression of these loci, none of the ABI transcription factors appear to interact directly with either FUS3 or LEC1 in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid assay system.",,Yes,This paragraph discusses LEC1 proteins but not RNAs.

An experimental method was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which jasmonates, cytokinins, and gibberellins modulate Arabidopsis leaf trichome formation. All three phytohormones provoked a seemingly common effect on cell patterning by promoting trichome initiation but caused strikingly distinct effects on cell and trichome maturation. The phytohormonal control was mediated by transcriptional regulation of the established TTG1 complex and depended on the R2R3-MYB factor GLABRA1. However, unsuspected degrees of functional specialization of the bHLH factors and a resultant differential molecular regulation of trichome initiation on leaf lamina and leaf margins were revealed. Trichome formation on leaf lamina relied entirely on GLABRA3 and ENHANCER OF GLABRA3.

Q5-2,seedev_dev_149,Exists_At_Stage,Protein,TTG1,Development_Phase,"Seed development is dependent on nutrients, such as a source of carbon, supplied by the parent plant. It remains largely unknown how these nutrients are distributed to zygotic and maternal tissues to coordinate storage of reserve compounds and development of protective tissues like seed coat. Here we show that phosphorylation of TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) is regulated by SHAGGY-like kinases 11/12 (SK11/12) and that this mediates carbon flow to fatty acid synthesis and seed coat traits in Arabidopsis seeds. SK11/12 phosphorylate TTG1 at serine 215, thus preventing TTG1 interaction with TRANSPARENT TESTA2. This compromises recruitment of TTG1 to the GLABRA2 locus and downregulates GLABRA2 expression, which enhances biosynthesis of fatty acids in the embryo, but reduces production of mucilage and flavonoid pigments in the seed coat. Therefore, site-specific phosphorylation of TTG1 by SK11/SK12 regulates carbon partitioning between zygotic and maternal sinks in seeds.",serine 215,No,Serine is an amino acid of the protein.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, trichome and root hair initiation requires a combination of three groups of proteins, including the WD40 repeat protein transparent TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1), R2R3 repeat MYB protein GLABRA1 (GL1), or werewolf (WER) and the IIIf subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein GLABRA3 (GL3) or enhancer of GLABRA3 (EGL3). The bHLH component acts as a docking site for TTG1 and MYB proteins. Here, we isolated a mutant showing defects in trichome and root hair patterning that carried a point mutation (R173H) in AtMYC1 that encodes the fourth member of IIIf bHLH family protein. Genetic analysis revealed partial redundant yet distinct function between AtMYC1 and GL3/EGL3. GLABRA2 (GL2), an important transcription factor involved in trichome and root hair control, was down-regulated in Atmyc1 plants, suggesting the requirement of AtMYC1 for appropriate GL2 transcription.

A white-flowered and glabrous mutant, line 17, of M. incana exhibits one nucleotide change, leading to an amino acid substitution directly in the WD motif (W158R). Correspondingly, the DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase) gene, in which the expression is known to be dependent on TTG1, is not expressed in Matthiola mutant lines 17 (and 19).
