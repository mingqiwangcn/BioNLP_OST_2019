Q1-1,agac_task3_96,GOF,Gene,GSTM1,Disease,"Glutathione S transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) gene has been associated with lung cancer (LC) risk, for GSTM1 enzyme playing a vital role in detoxification pathway and protective against toxic insults. The major objective of this study was to investigate GSTM1 deletion pattern and its association with LC in the world's population by using meta-prediction techniques. The secondary objective was to examine the effects of air pollution, smoking status, and other factors for gene-environment interactions with GSTM1 deletion and LC risk. We completed a comprehensive search to yield a total of 170 studies (40,296 cases and 48,346 controls) published from 1999 to 2017 for meta-analyses. The results revealed that GSTM1 deletion type was associated with increased risk of LC, while GSTM1 present type provided protective effect for all populations combined worldwide. Subgroup analysis on the rank order of risks from highest to lowest, among racial-ethnic groups, were Chinese, South East Asian, other North Asian, European, and finally American. Additional predictive analyses presented that air pollution played a significant role with increased risks of GSTM1 deletion and LC susceptibility, and the risks increased for smokers with higher levels of air pollution.",lung cancer,No,"Lung cancer is an effect of GSTM1 deletion, not gain of function."
Q1-2,agac_task3_96,GOF,Gene,GSTM1,Disease,"The GSTM1 genotype does not relate with remission and partial remission rates after 1 course treatment of AL patients, but relates with LDH level. GSTM1 null genotype deletion may play a role in risk of leukemia.",leukemia,No,Deletion and null genotypes are the opposite of gain of function.
Q1-3,agac_task3_96,GOF,Gene,GSTM1,Disease,"There was no statistical difference between groups in terms of both GSTT1 null genotype (OR = 1.114, 95% CI: 0.590-2.105) and GSTM1 null genotype (OR = 0.776, 95% CI: 0.466-1.290). This is the first case-control study investigating CYP1A1 Ile/Val, GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms in Turkish lung cancer patients. Although we suggest that other genes in addition to the proposed genes could play a role in lung cancer development, the results of our study will contribute to the possible associations between CYP1A1 Ile/Val, GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene polymorphism on the risk of lung cancer.",lung cancer,No,"This conclusion cannot be drawn from solely this paragraph. Null alleles have the same phenotype as deletion and ""polymorphism"" can refer to any alternative genotype, not only a gain of function."
Q1-4,agac_task3_96,GOF,Gene,GSTM1,Disease,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in carcinogenesis, and cellular antioxidant systems are important for detoxifying ROS and reversing oxidant-mediated modifications. Glutathione S-transferase mu (GSTM) belongs to a family of phase II detoxification enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to a wide range of endogenous and exogenous electrophilic compounds. The genotype of GSTM1 was associated with the risk and prognosis of cancer in several meta-analyses. This study explored the function of GSTM1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting (WB) were used to detect the levels of gene and protein expression. MTS assays, Transwell assays, and flow cytometry were used to explore the function of GSTM1 in vitro. The xenograft assay and tail vein injection model were used to explore the function of GSTM1 in vivo. The mRNA and protein expression of GSTM1 was downregulated in HCC, but the expression levels of GSTM1 were not correlated with patient survival time.",cancer,No,"GSTM1 has some alleles/polymorphisms that seem to lower cancer risk and some that appear to increase cancer risk, but deleting or nullifying the gene entirely has been found to increase cancer risk in multiple studies. There is no literature I could find on GSTM1 gain of function."
Q1-5,agac_task3_96,GOF,Gene,GSTM1,Disease,"However, the EM genotypes enhances the risk further for individuals harboring the GSTM1 null genotype as individuals harboring both the EM and the GSTM1 null genotypes have an odds ratio of 14.0 (95% CL = 1.3- 151.4, Fisher's exact P = 0.02) compared to individuals harboring the EM and the GSTM1 +/+ genotypes. In conclusion, our results indicate that genetic polymorphism, especially in GSTM1 and CYP2D6 could play an important role as host risk factors for development of urinary bladder cancer among Egyptians.",urinary bladder cancer,No,"Polymorphism does not strictly imply gain of function, simply means one of multiple alleles present."
Q2-1,agac_task3_98,GOF,Gene,HCN2,Disease,"In summary, a novel mutation in HCN2 likely leads to impaired GI motility, causing the severe growth restriction seen in mice with mutations that eliminate HCN2 expression.",impaired GI motility,No,Eliminating HCN2 expression is the opposite of a gain of function.
Q2-2,agac_task3_98,GOF,Gene,HCN2,Disease,"We hypothesized that localized overexpression of the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN2) pacemaker current isoform in canine left atrium (LA) would constitute a novel biological pacemaker. Adenoviral constructs of mouse HCN2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP alone were injected into LA, terminal studies performed 3 to 4 days later, hearts removed, and myocytes examined for native and expressed pacemaker current (I(f)). Spontaneous LA rhythms occurred after vagal stimulation-induced sinus arrest in 4 of 4 HCN2+GFP dogs and 0 of 3 GFP dogs (P<0.05). Native I(f) in nonexpressed atrial myocytes was 7+/-4 pA at -130 mV (n=5), whereas HCN2+GFP LA had expressed pacemaker current (I(HCN2)) of 3823+/-713 pA at -125 mV (n=10) and 768+/-365 pA at -85 mV. HCN2 overexpression provides an I(f)-based pacemaker sufficient to drive the heart when injected into a localized region of atrium, offering a promising gene therapy for pacemaker disease.",pacemaker disease,No,"The opposite conclusion should be drawn: overexpression of HCN2 can be used to treat pacemaker disease, as it provides a pacemaker sufficient to constitute a novel biological pacemaker and drive the heart."
Q2-3,agac_task3_98,GOF,Gene,HCN2,Disease,"This work demonstrates cell swelling as a new regulatory mechanism for the cloned hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (HCN2). HCN2 channels were coexpressed with aquaporin1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes and currents were monitored using a two-electrode voltage-clamp. HCN2 channels were activated by hyperpolarization to -100 mV and the currents were measured before and during hypoosmotic cell swelling. Cell swelling increased HCN2 currents by 30% without changing the kinetics of the currents. Injection of 50 nl intracellular solution resulted in a current increase of 20%, indicating that an increase in cell volume also under isoosmotic conditions may lead to activation of HCN2. In the absence of aquaporin1 only negligible changes in oocyte cell volume occur during exposure to hypoosmotic media and no significant change in HCN2 channel activity was observed during perfusion with hypoosmotic media. This indicates that cell swelling and not a change in ionic strength of the media, caused the observed swelling-induced increase in current. The increase in HCN2 current induced by cell swelling could be abolished by cytochalasin D treatment, indicating that an intact F-actin cytoskeleton is a prerequisite for the swelling-induced current.",cell swelling,No,"Cell swelling is observed here as a regulator of HCN2 current, not an outcome of its overexpression."
Q2-4,agac_task3_98,GOF,Gene,HCN2,Disease,"The genetic architecture of common epilepsies is largely unknown. HCNs are excellent epilepsy candidate genes because of their fundamental neurophysiological roles. Screening in subjects with febrile seizures and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus revealed that 2.4% carried a common triple proline deletion (delPPP) in HCN2 that was seen in only 0.2% of blood bank controls. Currents generated by mutant HCN2 channels were approximately 35% larger than those of controls; an effect revealed using automated electrophysiology and an appropriately powered sample size. This is the first association of HCN2 and familial epilepsy, demonstrating gain of function of HCN2 current as a potential contributor to polygenic epilepsy.",polygenic epilepsy,Yes,
Q2-5,agac_task3_98,GOF,Gene,HCN2,Disease,"Quantitative validation of HCN2 promoter methylation level in the region detected by BS-seq was performed in a larger cohort of primary tumors (n=32) confirming significant HCN2 hypomethylation in ACCs compared with normal samples (n=10; p=0.04). HCN2 immunohistochemical staining was performed on an ACC tissue microarray. HCN2 staining intensity and H-score, but not percentage of the positively stained cells, were significantly stronger in normal tissues than those of ACC tissues. With our novel screening and sequencing methods, we identified several gene candidates that were methylated. The most significant of these genes, HCN2, was actually hypomethylated in tumors. However, promoter methylation status does not appear to be a major determinant of HCN2 expression in normal and ACC tissues. HCN2 hypomethylation is a biomarker of ACC and may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of ACC.",carcinogenesis of ACC.,No,Hypomethylation (a modifier of a gene) of HCN2 is associated with carcinogenesis but this does not imply gain of function of the gene itself.
Q3-1,agac_task3_3,GOF,Gene,Shp2,Disease,"We have examined the effect of expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 on transformation by the mouse polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT). Gain-of-function mutations in Shp2 indicate that it may serve as an oncogene in several types of human leukemia. Paradoxically, however, some catalytically dominant-negative mutations of Shp2 have also been identified in leukemia and neuroblastomas. In this study, we show that Shp2 suppresses transformation induced by PyMT, the major polyoma viral oncoprotein known to act through binding and activation of pp60(c-src). Over-expression of a catalytically inactive Shp2 mutant in NIH3T3 cells significantly enhanced PyMT-induced transformation. Conversely, re-introduction of Shp2 into Shp2-deficient cells strongly inhibited PyMT-induced transformation and tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated Shp2 knockdown potentiated PyMT-induced transformation. Finally, we present evidence that the transformation-suppressive effects of Shp2 are mediated at least partially through the inhibition of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3.",leukemia,Yes,
Q3-2,agac_task3_3,GOF,Gene,Shp2,Disease,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) is crucial for normal brain development and has been implicated in dorsal telencephalic neuronal and astroglia cell fate decisions. However, its roles in the ventral telencephalon and during oligodendrogenesis in the telencephalon remain largely unknown. Shp2 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations are observed in Noonan syndrome, a type of RASopathy associated with multiple phenotypes, including cardiovascular, craniofacial, and neurocognitive abnormalities. To gain insight into requirements for Shp2 (LOF) and the impact of abnormal Shp2 GOF mutations, we used a Shp2 conditional mutant allele (LOF) and a cre inducible Shp2-Q79R GOF transgenic mouse in combination with Olig2(cre/+) mice to target embryonic ventral telencephalic progenitors and the oligodendrocyte lineage. In the absence of Shp2 (LOF), neuronal cell types originating from progenitors in the ventral telencephalon were generated, but oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) generation was severely impaired.",Noonan syndrome,Yes,
Q3-3,agac_task3_3,GOF,Gene,Shp2,Disease,The observation of recurrent mutations supports the hypothesis that a special class of gain-of-function mutations in SHP2 give rise to Noonan syndrome.,Noonan syndrome,Yes,
Q3-4,agac_task3_3,GOF,Gene,Shp2,Disease,"SHP2 phosphatase is a positive transducer of growth factor and cytokine signaling. SHP2 is also a bona fide oncogene; gain-of-function SHP2 mutations leading to increased phosphatase activity cause Noonan syndrome, as well as multiple forms of leukemia and solid tumors. We report that tautomycetin (TTN), an immunosuppressor in organ transplantation, and its engineered analog TTN D-1 are potent SHP2 inhibitors. TTN and TTN D-1 block T cell receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK activation and gain-of-function mutant SHP2-induced hematopoietic progenitor hyperproliferation and monocytic differentiation. Crystal structure of the SHP2⋅TTN D-1 complex reveals that TTN D-1 occupies the SHP2 active site in a manner similar to that of a peptide substrate. Collectively, the data support the notion that SHP2 is a cellular target for TTN and provide a potential mechanism for the immunosuppressive activity of TTN.",Noonan syndrome,Yes,
Q3-5,agac_task3_3,GOF,Gene,Shp2,Disease,"The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP2 is encoded by the proto-oncogene PTPN11 and is a ubiquitously expressed key regulator of cell signaling, acting on a number of cellular processes and components, including the Ras/Raf/Erk, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT pathways and immune checkpoint receptors. Aberrant SHP2 activity has been implicated in all phases of tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Gain-of-function PTPN11 mutations drive oncogenesis in several leukemias and cause developmental disorders with increased risk of malignancy such as Noonan syndrome. Until recently, small molecule-based targeting of SHP2 was hampered by the failure of orthosteric active-site inhibitors to achieve selectivity and potency within a useful therapeutic window. However, new SHP2 allosteric inhibitors with excellent potency and selectivity have sparked renewed interest in the selective targeting of SHP2 and other PTP family members. Crucially, drug discovery campaigns focusing on SHP2 would greatly benefit from the ability to validate the cellular target engagement of candidate inhibitors. Here, we report a cellular thermal shift assay that reliably detects target engagement of SHP2 inhibitors.",leukemias,Yes,
Q4-1,agac_task3_73,GOF,Gene,NT5C2,Disease,"Activating mutations in NT5C2, a gene encoding cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase (cN-II), confer chemoresistance in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we show that all mutants became independent of allosteric effects of ATP and thus constitutively active. Structural mapping of mutations described in patients demonstrates that 90% of leukemia-specific allelles directly affect two regulatory hotspots within the cN-II molecule-the helix A region: residues 355-365, and the intersubunit interface: helix B (232-242) and flexible interhelical loop L (400-418). Furthermore, analysis of hetero-oligomeric complexes combining wild-type (WT) and mutant subunits showed that the activation is transmitted from the mutated to the WT subunit. This intersubunit interaction forms structural basis of hyperactive NT5C2 in drug-resistant leukemia in which heterozygous NT5C2 mutation gave rise to hetero-tetramer mutant and WT proteins. This enabled us to define criteria to aid the prediction of NT5C2 drug resistance mutations in leukemia.",leukemia,No,"The gain of function is specifically attributed to drug-resistance in leukemia, not a direct cause of  leukemia itself."
Q4-2,agac_task3_73,GOF,Gene,NT5C2,Disease,"Activating mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene NT5C2 drive resistance to 6-mercaptopurine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we demonstrate that constitutively active NT5C2 mutations K359Q and L375F reconfigure the catalytic center for substrate access and catalysis in the absence of allosteric activator. In contrast, most relapse-associated mutations, which involve the arm segment and residues along the surface of the inter-monomeric cavity, disrupt a built-in switch-off mechanism responsible for turning off NT5C2. In addition, we show that the C-terminal acidic tail lost in the Q523X mutation functions to restrain NT5C2 activation. These results uncover dynamic mechanisms of enzyme regulation targeted by chemotherapy resistance-driving NT5C2 mutations, with important implications for the development of NT5C2 inhibitor therapies.",leukemia,No,"The gain of function is specifically attributed to drug-resistance in leukemia, not a direct cause of  leukemia itself."
Q4-3,agac_task3_73,GOF,Gene,NT5C2,Disease,"To investigate the expression level and analyze the clinical significance of NT5C2, which is an nucleoside analogues metabolism related gene, in children with acute leukemia (AL). Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were presented to detect the level of NT5C2 mRNA and its protein product cN- Ⅱ in bone marrow samples of 63 patients initially diagnosed with AL, 15 patients who achieved complete remission, 7 patients who relapsed and 16 non- hematologic malignancie controls. The expression of NT5C2 mRNA in different groups of AL and its relevance with clinical indicators were analyzed. ①The expression of NT5C2 mRNA in newly diagnosed B-ALL, TALL, AML and controls were 1.16 (0.89-2.25, 0.96 (0.74-1.25, 1.66 (0.84-3.15) and 0.88 (0.61-1.21), respectively. NT5C2 mRNA expression in AML (P<0.01) and B-ALL (P<0.05) cases were higher than that in controls; NT5C2 mRNA expression in T- ALL and in controls showed no significant difference (P>0.05).",leukemia,Yes,"Contrary to previous sources, this source correlates leukemia itself with high levels (overexpression) of NT5C2."
Q4-4,agac_task3_73,GOF,Gene,NT5C2,Disease,"Comparisons between cDNA ratios in heterozygotes and homozygotes for the risk alleles indicated that cis-effects on NT5C2 expression in the adult dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could be largely accounted for by genotype at these two risk variants. While not excluding effects on other genes in the region, this study implicates altered neural expression of BORCS7, AS3MT, and NT5C2 in susceptibility to schizophrenia arising from genetic variation at the chromosome 10q24 locus. © 2016 The Authors. American Journal of Medical Genetics Part B: Neuropsychiatric Genetics Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",schizophrenia,No,"While the gene itself is connected to a higher risk of schizophrenia, there is nothing in this paragraph suggesting that it is due specifically to a gain of function of the gene.

Q5-1,agac_task3_114,GOF,Gene,CACNA1C,Disease,"Gain-of-function mutations in CACNA1C, encoding the L-type Ca(2+) channel Cav1.2, cause Timothy syndrome (TS), a multi-systemic disorder with dysmorphic features, long-QT syndrome (LQTS) and autism spectrum disorders. TS patients have heterozygous mutations (G402S and G406R) located in the alternatively spliced exon 8, causing a gain-of-function by reduced voltage-dependence of inactivation. Screening 540 unrelated patients with non-syndromic forms of LQTS, we identified six functional relevant CACNA1C mutations in different regions of the channel. All these mutations caused a gain-of-function combining different mechanisms, including changes in current amplitude, rate of inactivation and voltage-dependence of activation or inactivation, similar as in TS. Computer simulations support the theory that the novel CACNA1C mutations prolong action potential duration. We conclude that genotype-negative LQTS patients should be investigated for mutations in CACNA1C, as a gain-of-function in Cav1.2 is likely to cause LQTS and only specific and rare mutations, i.e. in exon 8, cause the multi-systemic TS.",Timothy syndrome,Yes,
Q5-2,agac_task3_114,GOF,Gene,CACNA1C,Disease,"L-type voltage-gated calcium channels play an essential role in various physiological systems including neuronal excitation and any mutation or dysfunction in the channel has significant impact on human brain function resulting in psychiatric diseases. Particular gain-of-function mutations in CACNA1C encoding CaV1.2 have been associated with Timothy Syndrome, a devastating disease with a multi-organ phenotype. Efforts to understand the underlying pathophysiology and find therapeutic strategy have been spurred recently with the advances in stem cell technology, in particular those arising from patient-derived sources. In this review, we report on the recent advances in Timothy Syndrome research and on the methods used to study this disease.",Timothy Syndrome,Yes,
Q5-3,agac_task3_114,GOF,Gene,CACNA1C,Disease,"Mutations in the CACNA1C-encoded L-type calcium channel have been associated with Timothy syndrome (TS) with severe QT prolongation, syndactyly, facial dysmorphisms, developmental delay, and sudden death. Recently, patients hosting CACNA1C mutations with only long QT syndrome (LQTS) have been described. We sought to identify novel variants in CACNA1C associated with either TS or LQTS, and to determine the impact of the mutation on channel function. Two probands were identified with mutations in CACNA1C, one with a TS-associated mutation, G406R, and a second with genotype-negative LQTS. Illumina HiSeq 2000 whole exome sequencing on the genotype-negative LQTS proband revealed a novel variant, CACNA1C-L762F, that co-segregated within a multi-generational family. The missense mutation localized to the DII/DIII intracellular interlinker segment of the channel in a highly conserved region in close proximity to the 6th transmembrane segment of domain II (DIIS6). Whole cell patch clamp of heterologously expressed CACNA1C-L762F in TSA201 cells demonstrated slower inactivation tau and increased sustained and window current.",Timothy syndrome,Yes,
Q5-4,agac_task3_114,GOF,Gene,CACNA1C,Disease,"Large-scale genome-wide association studies have consistently shown that genetic variation in CACNA1C, a gene that encodes calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1C, increases risk for psychiatric disorders. CACNA1C encodes the Cav1.2 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, which themselves have been functionally implicated in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric syndromes. Research has concentrated on uncovering the underlying biological mechanisms that could be responsible for this increased risk. This review presents an overview of recent findings regarding Cacna1c variation in animal models, particularly focusing on behavioral phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as cognition, anxiety and depressive phenotypes, and fear conditioning.

Additionally, N2091S led to minor kinetic alterations including a -3.4 mV shift in V1/2 of activation. This study provides molecular and functional evidence that rare CACNA1C genetic variants may contribute to the underlying pathogenic basis for some cases of SUDY in either a gain or loss-of-function mechanism.",SUDY,No,This paragraph mentions both gain of function and loss of function and does not confirm which mechanism is associated with SUDY. Answer unclear.
