They are abundant in soil and have been extensively explored for their therapeutic applications. This versatile group of bacteria has adapted to diverse ecological habitats, which has drawn considerable attention of the scientific community in recent times as it has opened up new possibilities for novel metabolites that may help in solving some of the most challenging problems of the day, for example, novel drugs for drug-resistant human pathogens, affordable means to maintain ecological balance in various habitats, and alternative practices for sustainable agriculture. Traditionally, free dwelling soil actinobacteria have been the subject of intensive research. Of late, symbiotic actinobacteria residing as endophytes within the plant tissues have generated immense interest as potential source of novel compounds, which may find applications in medicine, agriculture, and environment. In the light of these possibilities, this review focuses on the diversity of endophytic actinobacteria isolated from the plants of extreme habitats and specific ecological niches.

Actinobacteria were assayed for their antifungal activity against 16 clinical Candida albicans and the compound analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS. The 31 actinobacterial strains were isolated and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that this ecosystem is rich on actinobacteria, with Streptomyces as the predominant genus. The PCR based screening of biosynthetic genes revealed the presence of PKS-I in six strains, PKS-II in four strains and NRPS in 11 strains.

Actinobacteria also playimportant roles in biogeochemical cycling and how soils develop. However, little is known about the effect of the vegetation type on the actinobacterial community structures in soils from arid regions. For these reasons, we have analyzed the actinobacterial communities of five types of ecosystem (tree grove, shrub, meadow, desert, and farm) in the Heihe river basin. Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, we found 11 classes of Actinobacteria, with dominant classes of Actinobacteria (36.2%), Thermoleophilia (28.3%), Acidimicrobiia (19.4%). Five classes, 15 orders, 20 families and 36 genera were present in all samples. The dominant generalist genera were Gaiella, Solirubrobacter, Nocardioides, Mycobacterium, and Pseudonocardia. The actinobacterial community structures were significantly affected by the environment and vegetation type. The diversity of the actinobacterial community in the desert ecosystem was high, and this ecosystem harbored the highest proportion of unclassified sequences, representing rare Actinobacteria.

Extreme ecosystems cause evolution of novel secondary metabolic pathways of Actinobacteria and increase the possible discovery of new biological functions of bioactive compounds. Here, we isolated 65 Actinobacteria from rhizosphere soil samples of Opuntia stricta. An Actinobacteria strain (named SCA3-4) was screened against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4, ATCC 76255). The strain produced pink-white aerial mycelia and brown substrate mycelium on Gause No. 1 agar. Biverticillate chains of cylindrical spores were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on alignment of 16S rRNA sequences, a constructed phylogenetic tree showed that strain SCA3-4 shared a 99.54% similarity with Streptomyces lilacinus NRRL B-1968T. The morphological, biochemical, physiological, and molecular characteristics further indicated that strain SCA3-4 belongs to the Streptomyces sp.

Q3-5,bb_train_315,Exhibits,Microorganism,Actinobacteria,Phenotype,"Actinobacteria are a large group of Gram-positive bacteria common in the environment, especially in the soil. They are morphologically diverse and extremely versatile in their metabolic activities. They produce tens of thousands of secondary metabolites with different biological activities. Exposure to actinobacteria in indoor environments is probably continuous, since they are both common environmental bacteria and human normal flora. However, the occurrence of some species of spore-forming filamentous actinomycetes has been associated with abnormal and health-hazardous situations, such as moisture damage of the building. The measured concentrations of actinobacteria indoors are low. Higher concentrations have been reported during the remediation work of moisture damaged buildings and in agricultural environments. Exposure to high concentrations of actinobacteria can cause allergic alveolitis. Other respiratory disorders have been reported, too and although the measured concentrations are low, the indoor exposure is always a mixture of many different agents, which may have synergistic effects. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that actinobacteria are very immunoactive and hence, potential causative agents for respiratory and other disorders.",They are morphologically diverse and extremely versatile in their metabolic activities,Yes,"Correct, but also correct in this paragraph would be ""immunoactive""."

The E. coli O157:H7 survival dynamics were investigated in 12 representative soils from Jiangsu Province, where the largest E. coli O157:H7 infection in China occurred. It was observed that E. coli O157:H7 declined rapidly in acidic soils (pH, 4.57 - 5.14) but slowly in neutral soils (pH, 6.51 - 7.39). The survival dynamics were well described by the Weibull model, with the calculated td value (survival time of the culturable E. coli O157:H7 needed to reach the detection limit of 100 CFU g(-1)) from 4.57 days in an acidic soil (pH, 4.57) to 34.34 days in a neutral soil (pH, 6.77). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that soil pH and soil organic carbon favored E. coli O157:H7 survival, while a high initial ratio of Gram-negative bacteria phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) to Gram-positive bacteria PLFAs, and high content of exchangeable potassium inhibited E. coli O157:H7 survival.",hazardous,No,Hazardous is not a phenotype.

The survival time of E. coli O157:H7 in estuarine sediments increased with the distance to the water-land junction. Sediment pH was the most important factor in regulating E. coli O157:H7 survival in estuarine sediments. In addition, sediment nutrients and texture also played significant roles in the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the sediments. On the other hand, bacterial diversity as determined by the alpha-diversity index had no significant effect on E. coli O157:H7 survival. However, specific families of bacteria were closely associated with E. coli O157:H7 survival in the sediments.

Therefore, the efficacy of MacConkey agar containing sorbitol (SMAC medium) instead of lactose as a differential medium for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in stool cultures was determined in comparison with MacConkey agar. The relative frequency of non-sorbitol-fermenting (NSF) organisms other than E. coli O157:H7 in feces was low at 10 to 20% (95% confidence limits), and NSF organisms also occurred mostly in small numbers.

Full-thickness sheets of murine cecum were mounted in Ussing chambers and short circuit current and tissue electrical conductance were periodically determined to assess active transepithelial ion transport and ionic permeability, respectively. Neurochemicals and stationary-phase E. coli O157:H7 were exposed respectively to the contraluminal and luminal aspects of the mucosa. Epithelial adherence of E. coli O157:H7 was quantified by a bacterial adhesion assay after 90 min of luminal E. coli O157:H7 exposure.

The elements governing the expression of the tts gene, coding for the glucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the type 37 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, have been studied. Primer extension analysis and functional tests demonstrated the presence of four new transcriptional start points upstream of the previously reported tts promoter (ttsp). Most interesting, three of these transcriptional start points are located in a RUP element thought to be involved in recombinational events (Oggioni, M. R., and Claverys, J. P.

We further focused on LL-37 and determined its expression in human cornea infected with S. pneumoniae and studied the killing ability of LL-37 against S. pneumoniae. The expression of AMPs was determined by quantitative PCR and the phosphorylation of signaling proteins was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. LL-37 expression was also determined by immunofluorescence and Western blot method and the killing ability of LL-37 against S. pneumoniae was determined by colony-forming units.
