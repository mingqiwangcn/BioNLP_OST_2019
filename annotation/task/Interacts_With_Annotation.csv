Q1-1,seedev_dev_256,Interacts_With,Protein,SAP18,Protein,"Sap18, an adaptor molecule of the Sin3/HDAC transcriptional repressor complex, was found to interact with the C-terminal portion of the Hairy1 protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay and the Hairy1/Sap18 interaction was independently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We have characterized the expression patterns of both sap18 and sin3a genes during chick embryo development, using in situ hybridization experiments. We found that both sap18 and sin3a expression patterns co-localize in vivo with hairy1 expression domains in chick rostral presomitic mesoderm and caudal region of somites. Hairy1 belongs to the hairy-enhancer-of-split family of transcriptional repressor proteins. Our results indicate that during chick somitogenesis Hairy1 may mediate gene transcriptional repression by recruiting the Sin3/HDAC complex, through a direct interaction with the Sap18 adaptor molecule. Moreover, since sap18 and sin3a are not expressed in the PSM territory where hairy1 presents cyclic expression, our study strongly points to different roles for Hairy1 throughout the PSM and in the prospective somite and caudal region of already formed somites.",Hairy1,Yes,
Q1-2,seedev_dev_256,Interacts_With,Protein,SAP18,Protein,"DNA polymerase epsilon is essential for cell viability and chromosomal DNA replication in budding yeast. In addition, DNA polymerase epsilon may be involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoint control. The enzyme consists of at least four subunits in mammalian cells as well as in yeast. The largest subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon is responsible for polymerase activity. To date, the functions of the other subunits have remained unknown. With a view to elucidating the functions of the second largest subunit of mouse DNA polymerase epsilon (DPE2), yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to identify mouse proteins that interact with this subunit. SAP18, a polypeptide associated with co-repressor protein Sin3, was identified as an interacting protein. A part of the N-terminal region of DPE2 (comprising amino acids 85-250) was found to be responsible for the interaction with SAP18. The interaction induced repression of transcription in reporter plasmid assays, which was inhibited by trichostatin A. These results indicate that DPE2 may recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) to the replication fork to modify the chromatin structure.",Sin3,Yes,
Q1-3,seedev_dev_256,Interacts_With,Protein,SAP18,Protein,"An important event in gene expression is the covalent modification of histone proteins. We have found that the mammalian transcriptional repressor Sin3 (mSin3) exists in a complex with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. Consistent with the observation that mSin3-mediated repression of transcription involves the modification of histone polypeptides, we found that the mSin3-containing complex includes polypeptides that tether the mSin3 complex to core histone proteins. In addition, two novel mSin3-associated polypeptides, SAP18 and SAP30, were identified. We isolated a cDNA encoding human SAP18 and found that SAP18 is a component of an mSin3-containing complex in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate a direct interaction between SAP18 and mSin3. SAP18 represses transcription in vivo when tethered to the promoter, consistent with the ability of SAP18 to interact with mSin3.",mSin3,Yes,
Q1-4,seedev_dev_256,Interacts_With,Protein,SAP18,Protein,These studies indicated that SAP18 expression enhanced the recruitment of mSin3A in coordination with TRIB1 to MTTP regulatory elements and increased MTTP expression.,mSin3A,Yes,
Q1-5,seedev_dev_256,Interacts_With,Protein,SAP18,Protein,"Development of the insect head is a complex process that in Drosophila requires the anterior determinant, Bicoid. Bicoid is present in an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient, and binds DNA and stimulates transcription of head-specific genes. Many of these genes, including the gap-gene hunchback, are initially activated in a broad domain across the head primordium, but later retract so that their expression is cleared from the anterior-most segmented regions. Here, we show that retraction requires a Bicoid-interacting protein, Sap18, which is part of the Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex. In sensitized-mutant backgrounds (e.g., bcdE1/+, removal of maternal sap18 results in embryos that are missing labrally derived parts of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton. These sap18 mutant embryos fail to repress hb expression, and show reduced anterior cap expression of the labral determinant cap 'n' collar. These phenotypes are enhanced by lowering the dose of rpd3, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the deacetylase complex. The results suggest a model where, in labral regions of the head, Bicoid is converted from an activator into a repressor by recruitment of a co-repressor to Bicoid-dependent promoters.",Sin3/Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex.,No,Best answer found in this paragraph is Bicoid.
Q2-1,seedev_dev_210,Interacts_With,Protein,AGL15,Protein_Family,"Yeast two-hybrid studies have demonstrated that AGL15 can interact with AP1 (de Folter et al., 2005) and SEP3 (Figure 4), both of which have reported transactivation functions (Cho et al., 1999; Honma and Goto, 2001; Ng and Yanofsky, 2001; Pelaz et al., 2001). It is interesting to note that the conserved LENETLNRRQxxE motif resides within a region of AGL15 that is necessary and sufficient to allow interaction with SEP3 in yeast (data not shown). There are numerous examples in the literature of protein interactions determining whether a protein acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor. Known transcriptional activators have been shown to exert a repressive function through recruitment of SIN3/HDAC1 (Cheng and Bishop, 2002; Yang et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 2001). Co-activators that interact with SIN3/HDAC1 members, giving the complex an activator function, have also been reported. In the literature HDACs are generally associated with the repression of gene expression; however, in plants HDA19 has been shown to interact with bnKCP, and exerts a modest transactivation of reporter genes (Gao et al., 2003).",Yeast,No,Yeast is the organism under study; best answer found in the paragraph is AP1 and/or SEP3.
Q2-2,seedev_dev_210,Interacts_With,Protein,AGL15,Protein_Family,"However, AGL15 and AGL18 levels were unaffected by ectopic expression of SAP18 alone, possibly indicating a more specific interaction at these loci. We have demonstrated that AGL15 binds to LEA76 (At1g52690) (Figure 6a), and that LEA76 is repressed by AGL15 and/or SAP18 in a variety of tissues, including seedlings (Figure 5). Published results support a role for SIN3/HDAC1-mediated repression in regulation of LEA76: trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of HDAC, causes an increase in LEA76 transcript during seed germination (Tai et al., 2005).",LEA76,Yes,
Q2-3,seedev_dev_210,Interacts_With,Protein,AGL15,Protein_Family,"AGL18, which is most similar in sequence to the embryo-expressed AGL15 gene, is expressed in the endosperm and in developing male and female gametophytes, suggesting a role for AGL18 that is distinct from previously characterized MADS-box genes. Finally, AGL16 RNA accumulates in leaf guard cells and trichomes. Our new phylogeny reveals seven new monophyletic clades of MADS-box sequences not specific to flowers, suggesting that complex regulatory networks involving several MADS-box genes, similar to those that control flower development, underlie development of vegetative structures.",endosperm,No,Endosperm is the tissue where AGL18 is expressed.
Q2-4,seedev_dev_210,Interacts_With,Protein,AGL15,Protein_Family,"Multiple factors, including the MADS-domain proteins AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) and AGL18, contribute to the regulation of the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. AGL15 and AGL18 were previously shown to act redundantly as floral repressors and upstream of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). A series of genetic and molecular experiments, primarily focused on AGL15, was performed to more clearly define their role. agl15 agl18 mutations fail to suppress ft mutations but show additive interactions with short vegetative phase (svp) mutations in ft and suppressor of constans1 (soc1) backgrounds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses with AGL15-specific antibodies indicate that AGL15 binds directly to the FT locus at sites that partially overlap those bound by SVP and FLOWERING LOCUS C. In addition, expression of AGL15 in the phloem effectively restores wild-type flowering times in agl15 agl18 mutants. When agl15 agl18 mutations are combined with agl24 svp mutations, the plants show upward curling of rosette and cauline leaves, in addition to early flowering.",MADS-domain,No,AGL15 is an example of a MADS-domain protein.
Q2-5,seedev_dev_210,Interacts_With,Protein,AGL15,Protein_Family,"Microarray analysis of hsi2-4 and hsi2-4                         hsl1 mutants indicated that the HSI2 PHD-like domain functions non-redundantly to repress a subset of seed maturation genes, including those that encode AGL15 (AGAMOUS-LIKE15), FUSCA3 (FUS3), cruciferins, cupin family proteins, late-embryogenesis abundant protein, oleosins, 2S albumins and other seed-specific proteins in Arabidopsis seedlings. Many genes that are responsive to this mutation in the HSI2 PHD-like domain are enriched in histone H3 trimethylation on lysine 27 residues (H3K27me3), a repressive epigenetic mark. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that sequences of the GSTF8::LUC transgene are enriched in H3K27me3 in a HSI2 PHD domain-dependent manner. These results indicate that the transcriptional repression activity of the HSI2 PHD domain could be mediated, at least in part, by its participation in the deposition of H3K27me3 on the chromatin of specific target genes.",cupin family proteins,No,There is no evidence in this paragraph that AGL15 interacts with cupin family proteins; it only mentions that they both are seed maturation genes.
Q3-1,seedev_train_714,Interacts_With,Protein,HDA19,Protein,"HDA19 has also been shown to interact with BnSCL1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis SCARECROW-like protein 15 (SCL15), and likewise exerts transcriptional activation of reporter genes (Gao et al., 2004).",BnSCL1,Yes,
Q3-2,seedev_train_714,Interacts_With,Protein,HDA19,Protein,"The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root epidermis is a simple model for investigating cell fate specification and pattern formation. In addition to regulatory networks consisting of transcription factors, histone deacetylases are also involved in the formation of cellular patterns. Here, we report thatHistone Deacetylase19 (HDA19) affects the root epidermal cellular pattern through regulation of cortical cell fate by interacting with SCARECROW (SCR). HDA19 binds to the DNA sequence upstream of SCR, as well as to those of several of SCR's target genes, and regulates their expression. Mutant lines of several SCR target genes show impaired patterns of epidermal differentiation and cortical cell division, similar to that of hda19 This work presents HDA19 and SCR as two further players in the regulation of cortical and epidermal cell specification and describes an additional function for SCR.",SCARECROW,Yes,

These data increased our understanding of the mechanisms on citrus B-toxicity and B-tolerance at transcriptional level.",nucleic acid,No,"Nucleic acids are not proteins, and this paragraph does not imply an interaction."
Q3-5,seedev_train_714,Interacts_With,Protein,HDA19,Protein,"The development and coordination of complex tissues in eukaryotes requires precise spatial control of fate-specifying genes. Although investigations of such control have traditionally focused on mechanisms of transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression has emerged as being equally important in the establishment of gene expression territories. In the angiosperm flower, specification of lateral organ fate relies on the spatial regulation of the ABC floral organ identity genes. Our understanding of how the boundaries of these expression domains are controlled is not complete. Here, we report that the A-class organ identity gene APETALA2 (AP2), which is known to repress the C-class gene AGAMOUS, also regulates the expression borders of the B-class genes APETALA3 and PISTILLATA, and the E-class gene SEPALLATA3. We show that AP2 represses its target genes by physically recruiting the co-repressor TOPLESS and the histone deacetylase HDA19. These results demonstrate that AP2 plays a broad role in flower development by controlling the expression domains of numerous floral organ identity genes.",histone deacetylase,No,"Equivalent, not interacting."
Q4-1,seedev_train_86,Interacts_With,Protein,ABI3,Protein_Domain,"A previous study showed that SOMNUS (SOM), which encodes a C3H-type zinc finger protein, is a key negative regulator of seed germination that acts downstream of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3-LIKE5 (PIL5). However, it was not determined if PIL5 is the sole regulator of SOM expression. Public microarray data suggest that the expression of SOM mRNA is regulated also by ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), another key regulator of seed germination. By analyzing abi3 mutants and ABI3 overexpression lines, we show here that ABI3 activates the expression of SOM mRNA collaboratively with PIL5 in imbibed seeds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis coupled with electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicate that ABI3 activates the expression of SOM mRNA by directly binding to two RY motifs present in the SOM promoter in vivo, which is further supported by the greatly decreased expression of a reporter gene driven by a SOM promoter bearing mutated RY motifs. At the protein level, the ABI3 protein interacts with the PIL5 protein. The ABI3-PIL5 interaction, however, does not affect targeting of ABI3 and PIL5 to SOM promoters.",PIL5,Yes,
Q4-2,seedev_train_86,Interacts_With,Protein,ABI3,Protein_Domain,"Genetic and molecular studies have shown that the Arabidopsis ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) protein plays a prominent role in the control of seed maturation. The ABI3 protein and its orthologues from various other plant species share four domains of high sequence identity, including three basic domains designated as B1, B2 and B3. The leaky abi3-1 mutation is a single amino acid substitution within the B3 domain. A new abi3 allele, abi3-7, was generated by mutagenizing abi3-1 seeds. The abi3-7 line contains, in addition to the abi3-1 mutation, a point mutation that converts residue Ala-458 into Thr within the B2 domain of the ABI3 protein. This Ala residue is absolutely conserved in all known ABI3 orthologues. Abi3-7 seeds display reductions in dormancy and in sensitivity to abscisic acid which are intermediate between those of the leaky abi3-1 and of the severe abi3-4 and abi3-5 mutants. Accumulation and distribution of At2S1 and At2S2 albumin mRNA as well as of AtEm1 and AtEm6 late embryogenesis-abundant proteins and mRNA have been analyzed.",Arabidopsis ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3,No,"Abscisic acid-insensitive3 is what ABI3 stands for, not new information."
Q4-3,seedev_train_86,Interacts_With,Protein,ABI3,Protein_Domain,"Seeds germination or dormancy is strictly controlled by endogenous phytohormone signal and environment cues. High temperature (HT) suppresses seeds germination or triggers seeds dormancy but underlying mechanism by which HT mediates seeds germination thermoinhibition needs more investigating. SOM is reported as the critical factor negatively controls light-irradiation seeds germination by altering Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin acid (GA) biosynthesis. Here we found that HT accelerates SOM expressing through ABA signal transduction component ABI3, both of abi3 and som mutants seeds show high germination rate under HT in contrast to wild type seeds. Using ABI3 as the bait, we identified the epigenetic factor Powerdress (PWR) as the ABI3 interaction protein. Genetic and physiological analysis showed that PWR negatively control the expressing of SOM, and overexpressing PWR enhanced, while pwr mutant reduced, seeds germination thermotolerance.",epigenetic factor Powerdress (PWR),Yes,
Q4-4,seedev_train_86,Interacts_With,Protein,ABI3,Protein_Domain,"The transcriptional activator ABI3 is a key regulator of gene expression during embryo maturation in crucifers. In monocots, the related VP1 protein regulates the Em promoter synergistically with abscisic acid (ABA). We identified cis-elements in the Brassica napus napin napA promoter mediating regulation by ABI3 and ABA, by analyzing substitution mutation constructs of napA in transgenic tobacco plantlets ectopically expressing ABI3. In transient analysis using particle bombardment of tobacco leaf sections, a tetramer of the distB ABRE (abscisic acid-responsive element) mediated transactivation by ABI3 and ABI3-dependent response to ABA, whereas a tetramer of the composite RY/G complex, containing RY repeats and a G-box, mediated only ABA-independent transactivation by ABI3. Deletion of the conserved B2 and B3 domains of ABI3 abolished transactivation of napA by ABI3. The two domains of ABI3 interact with different cis-elements: B2 is necessary for ABA-independent and ABA-dependent activations through the distB ABRE, whereas B3 interacts with the RY/G complex. Thus B2 mediates the interaction of ABI3 with the protein complex at the ABRE.",B2,No,"B2 is a domain of ABI3, not a new protein."
Q4-5,seedev_train_86,Interacts_With,Protein,ABI3,Protein_Domain,"Both At2S1 and At2S2 mRNA are reduced in abi3-7, but distribution of At2S2 is spatially restricted. Accumulation of AtEm6 protein is more sensitive to abi3-7 mutation than AtEm1. However both mRNAs are considerably reduced in this mutant. Their distribution is also differentially affected. These results provide genetic evidence for the importance of the conserved B2 domain for ABI3 function in vivo.",B2,No,"B2 is a domain of ABI3, not a new protein."
Q5-1,seedev_train_528,Interacts_With,Protein_Family,14-3-3 proteins,Protein_Family,"We wondered whether 14-3-3 proteins function as regulators of Rac1-mediated keratinocyte migration patterns. In support of this hypothesis, inhibition of Rac1 results in an increase in 14-3-3 protein association with SSH. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism in which alpha6beta4 integrin signaling via Rac1, 14-3-3 proteins, and SSH family members regulates cofilin activation, cell polarity, and matrix assembly, leading to specific epidermal cell migration behavior.",SSH,Yes,

The amphipathic groove of 14-3-3 is the main structural feature involved in mediating its associations. We have studied another domain of 14-3-3, the C-terminal loop, to determine what role it plays in ligand interaction. A truncated form of 14-3-3zeta lacking this C-terminal loop was generated and found to bind with higher affinity than the wild-type 14-3-3zeta protein to the ligands Raf-1 and Bad. Interestingly, the truncated 14-3-3zeta also showed increased association with the 14-3-3 binding-deficient Bad/S136A mutant. Taken together, these data support a role for the C-terminal loop as a general inhibitor of 14-3-3/ligand interactions.

They interact with more than 200 different, mostly phosphorylated proteins. The molecular consequences of 14-3-3 binding are diverse: this binding may result in stabilization of the active or inactive phosphorylated form of the protein, to a conformational alteration leading to activation or inhibition, to a different subcellular localization, to the interaction with other proteins or to shielding of binding sites. The binding partners, and hence the 14-3-3 proteins, are involved in almost every cellular process and 14-3-3 proteins have been linked to several diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, the neurological Miller-Dieker and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 diseases and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
