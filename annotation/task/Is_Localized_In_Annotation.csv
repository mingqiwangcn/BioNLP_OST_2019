Q1-1,seedev_train_881,Is_Localized_In,RNA,PINHEAD transcripts,Tissue,"RNA-based studies are an important tool for the identification and functional characterization of mutations underlying inherited disease. These studies could in principle be compromised by 'aberrant splicing' (the generation of alternatively spliced transcripts lacking any obvious function) during normal expression of the genes under investigation. Using a highly sensitive RT-PCR assay, we show here that aberrant splicing is a frequent occurrence during expression of the protein C (PROC) and protein S (PROS) genes. Aberrantly spliced transcripts were present in different cell types including liver, the main expressing tissue for both protein C and protein S. In an attempt to compare individual mRNA splicing patterns, PROC and PROS RNA from easily accessible cells of different healthy control individuals was studied. However, variation between different RT-PCR assays from the same individual precluded both the relative quantitation of the aberrant transcripts and the analysis of interindividual differences. Our findings are consistent with the notion that a low level of aberrantly spliced transcripts are routinely generated during PROC and PROS gene expression. The possibility that these transcripts may complicate the RT-PCR analysis of pathological transcripts must be taken into account when RNA-based strategies of disease analysis are considered.",liver,No,Subject not mentioned.
Q1-2,seedev_train_881,Is_Localized_In,RNA,PINHEAD transcripts,Tissue,"c-mos RNA transcripts have been previously detected in mouse gonadal tissue and in late-term embryos. Here, we show that they are also present at low levels in placenta and in adult mouse brain, kidney, mammary gland, and epididymis. Marked differences are observed in the size of the mos RNA transcripts detected in different tissues. All transcripts appear to end at the same 3' position, and the tissue-specific size variations appear to be due to the use of different promoters. For example, the testicular and ovarian RNA transcripts initiate approximately 280 and approximately 70 base pairs, respectively, upstream from the first initiation codon, but both end at a common site downstream from the mos open reading frame. The expression of mos is developmentally regulated in gonadal tissue. Thus, the level of mos transcripts in testes is low for the first 3 weeks after birth, increases at least 10-fold around day 25, and reaches adult levels by day 30. In contrast, ovaries from preweaning mice contain a higher level of mos mRNA compared to ovaries from adult mice. In cell fractionation experiments we show that mos transcripts are present in haploid germ cells. We find that these transcripts are associated with monosomes and polysomes.",mouse gonadal tissue,No,Subject not mentioned.
Q1-3,seedev_train_881,Is_Localized_In,RNA,PINHEAD transcripts,Tissue,"The diploid frog X. tropicalis has recently been adopted as a model genetic system, but loss-of-function screens in Xenopus have not yet been performed. We have undertaken a pilot functional knockdown screen in X. tropicalis for genes involved in nervous system development by injecting antisense morpholino (MO) oligos directed against X. tropicalis mRNAs. Twenty-six genes with primary expression in the nervous system were selected as targets based on an expression screen previously conducted in X. laevis. Reproducible phenotypes were observed for six and for four of these, a second MO gave a similar result. One of these genes encodes a novel protein with previously unknown function. Knocking down this gene, designated pinhead, results in severe microcephaly, whereas, overexpression results in macrocephaly. Together with the early embryonic expression in the anterior neural plate, these data indicate that pinhead is a novel gene involved in controlling head development.",anterior neural plate,Yes,
Q1-4,seedev_train_881,Is_Localized_In,RNA,PINHEAD transcripts,Tissue,"RNA was isolated from tissue of two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma developed on the background of a chronic hepatitis B virus infection. For identification and characterization of 3' ends of X gene open reading frame (ORF)-related transcripts, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and subjected to polymerase chain reaction. Cloned amplification products from tumor tissue of one patient represented an approximately even distribution of transcripts terminating at the established poly(A) signal (standard transcripts) and of truncated transcripts terminating at a CATAAA poly(A) signal within the 3' end region of X gene ORF (truncated transcripts). Amplified cDNA from tumor tissue of the second patient could be attributed mainly to the standard type of transcripts, whereas cDNA from the nontumor tissue of the same patient could be assigned to four groups of transcripts: (i) standard transcripts, (ii) transcripts with internal deletions affecting the 3' end of the X gene, (iii) truncated transcripts, and (iv) hybrid transcripts displaying 5' sequences from the X gene ORF fused to cellular sequences.",hepatocellular carcinoma,No,Subject not mentioned.
Q1-5,seedev_train_881,Is_Localized_In,RNA,PINHEAD transcripts,Tissue,"The focal distributions of RNAs observed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the cell nucleus may correspond either to RNAs in the course of transcription or essentially to accumulation of full-length transcripts at the sites of transcription. To determine to what extent nuclear transcript foci represent growing RNA molecules, uninterrupted hsp70 transcripts were detected by FISH in heat-shocked human fibroblasts using two probes specific for the 5' or for the 3' end of the transcripts. By comparing the size of the signals obtained with each probe, we show that transcript foci mainly represent accumulations of full-length transcripts at their site of transcription. A major contribution of RNAs in the course of transcription to the transcript foci is observed only during the first minutes of gene induction. These observations suggest the existence of a rate-limiting step in the release of newly synthesized transcripts from their site of transcription, which is independent from the step of intron excision.",fibroblasts,Yes,
Q2-1,seedev_train_885,Is_Localized_In,Hormone,auxin,Tissue,"Modification of host hormone biology is a common strategy used by plant pathogens to promote disease. For example, the bacterial pathogen strain Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PtoDC3000) produces the plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) to promote PtoDC3000 growth in plant tissue. Previous studies suggest that auxin may promote PtoDC3000 pathogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including both suppression of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated host defenses and via an unknown mechanism that appears to be independent of SA. To test if host auxin signaling is important during pathogenesis, we took advantage of Arabidopsis thaliana lines impaired in either auxin signaling or perception. We found that disruption of auxin signaling in plants expressing an inducible dominant axr2-1 mutation resulted in decreased bacterial growth and that this phenotype was suppressed by introducing the sid2-2 mutation, which impairs SA synthesis. Thus, host auxin signaling is required for normal susceptibility to PtoDC3000 and is involved in suppressing SA-mediated defenses. Unexpectedly, tir1 afb1 afb4 afb5 quadruple-mutant plants lacking four of the six known auxin coreceptors that exhibit decreased auxin perception, supported increased levels of bacterial growth.",plant tissue,Yes,"A very general answer, but accurate from the paragraph."
Q2-2,seedev_train_885,Is_Localized_In,Hormone,auxin,Tissue,"The plant hormone auxin transcriptionally activates early genes in pea. We have developed a transient assay system using protoplasts of auxin-responsive pea seedling cells to define the auxin-responsive element, AuxRE, of the early auxin-induced PS-IAA4/5 gene. The auxin responsive protoplasts show an authentic hormonal response identical to that observed in intact pea tissue, with respect to rapidity, specificity and cycloheximide (CHX) inducibility of the PS-IAA4/5 transcript. The hormone also mediates rapid and specific induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in protoplasts transfected with a chimeric IAA4/5-CAT gene. The IAA-induced CAT activity is developmentally regulated and is observed only in protoplasts derived from auxin-responsive regions of the pea seedling. Extensive deletion analysis of the PS-IAA4/5 promoter defined a promoter region between -318 and -154 that confers auxin inducibility. This AuxRE mediates auxin-inducible CAT activity in pea cells driven by the non auxin-responsive CaMV 35S minimal promoter.",pea,Yes,"A very general answer, but accurate from the paragraph."
Q2-3,seedev_train_885,Is_Localized_In,Hormone,auxin,Tissue,"The vegetative hormone Auxin is involved in vascular tissues formation throughout the plant. Trans-membrane carrier proteins transporting auxin from cell to cell and distributed asymmetrically around each cell give to auxin a polarized movement in tissues, creating streams of auxin that presume future vascular bundles. According to the canalization hypothesis, auxin transport ability of cells is thought to increase with auxin flux, resulting in the self-enhancement of this flux along auxin paths. In this study we evaluate a series of models based on canalization hypothesis using carrier proteins, under different assumptions concerning auxin flux formation and carrier protein dynamics. Simulations are run on a hexagonal lattice with uniform auxin production. A single cell located in the margin of the lattice indicates the petiole, and acts as an auxin sink. The main results are: (1) We obtain branching auxin distribution patterns. (2) The type of self-enhancement described by the functional form of the carrier proteins regulation responding to the auxin flux intensity in different parts of a cell, has a strong effect on the possibility of generating the branching patterns. For response functions with acceleration in the increase of carrier protein numbers compared to the auxin flux, branching patterns are likely to be generated. For linear or decelerating response functions, no branching patterns are formed.",vascular,Yes,
Q2-4,seedev_train_885,Is_Localized_In,Hormone,auxin,Tissue,"The plant hormone auxin plays crucial roles in regulating plant growth development, including embryo and root patterning, organ formation, vascular tissue differentiation and growth responses to environmental stimuli. Asymmetric auxin distribution patterns have been observed within tissues, and these so-called auxin gradients change dynamically during different developmental processes. Most auxin is synthesized in the shoot and distributed directionally throughout the plant. This polar auxin transport is mediated by auxin influx and efflux facilitators, whose subcellular polar localizations guide the direction of auxin flow. The polar localization of PIN auxin efflux carriers changes in response to developmental and external cues in order to channel auxin flow in a regulated manner for organized growth. Auxin itself modulates the expression and subcellular localization of PIN proteins, contributing to a complex pattern of feedback regulation. Here we review the available information mainly from studies of a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, on the generation of auxin gradients, the regulation of polar auxin transport and further downstream cellular events.",vascular,Yes,
Q2-5,seedev_train_885,Is_Localized_In,Hormone,auxin,Tissue,"Positional information is essential for coordinating the development of multicellular organisms. In plants, positional information provided by the hormone auxin regulates rhythmic organ production at the shoot apex, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of auxin gradients is unknown. We used quantitative imaging to demonstrate that auxin carries high-definition graded information not only in space but also in time. We show that, during organogenesis, temporal patterns of auxin arise from rhythmic centrifugal waves of high auxin travelling through the tissue faster than growth. We further demonstrate that temporal integration of auxin concentration is required to trigger the auxin-dependent transcription associated with organogenesis. This provides a mechanism to temporally differentiate sites of organ initiation and exemplifies how spatio-temporal positional information can be used to create rhythmicity.",plants,No,*
Q3-1,seedev_train_237,Is_Localized_In,Pathway,production of mucilage,Tissue,"The mature seed coat, in addition to forming a protective layer around the embryo, can play roles in such processes as seed dispersal and germination. One adaptation believed to act in these processes is the production of mucilage in the epidermal cells of the seed coat. This specialization, known as myxospermy, is found in many families, including the Brassicaceae, Solanaceae, Linaceae, and Plantaginaceae (Grubert, 1981; Boesewinkel and Bouman, 1995). Seed imbibition in these plants leads to the formation of a gel capsule around the seed that is thought to aid hydration and/or dispersal.",epidermal cells,Yes,
Q3-2,seedev_train_237,Is_Localized_In,Pathway,production of mucilage,Tissue,"Nonvascular, symplasmic transport of sucrose (Suc) was investigated theoretically in the primary root tip of maize (Zea mays L. cv WF9 x Mo 17) seedlings. Symplasmic diffusion has been assumed to be the mechanism of transport of Suc to cells in the root apical meristem (R.T. Giaquinta, W. Lin, N.L. Sadler, V.R. Franceschi [1983] Plant Physiol 72: 362-367), which grow apical to the end of the phloem and must build all biomass with carbon supplied from the shoot or kernel. We derived an expression for the growth-sustaining Suc flux, which is the minimum longitudinal flux that would be required to meet the carbon demands of growth in the root apical meristem. We calculated this flux from data on root growth velocity, area, and biomass density, taking into account construction and maintenance respiration and the production of mucilage by the root cap. We then calculated the conductivity of the symplasmic pathway for diffusion, from anatomical data on cellular dimensions and the frequency and dimensions of plasmodesmata, and from two estimates of the diffusive conductance of a plasmodesma, derived from independent data.",root cap,Yes,
Q3-3,seedev_train_237,Is_Localized_In,Pathway,production of mucilage,Tissue,"On imbibition, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds release polysaccharides from their epidermal cells that form a two-layered hydrogel, termed mucilage. Analysis of a publicly available data set of outer seed mucilage traits of over 300 accessions showed little natural variation in composition. This mucilage is almost exclusively made up of rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI), highlighting the importance of this pectin for outer mucilage function. In a genome-wide association study, observed variations in polymer amount and macromolecular characteristics were linked to several genome polymorphisms, indicating the complexity of their genetic regulation. Natural variants with high molar mass were associated with a gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase called MUCILAGE-RELATED70 (MUCI70). muci70 insertion mutants produced many short RGI polymers that were highly substituted with xylan, confirming that polymorphism in this gene can affect RGI polymer size. A second gene encoding a putative copper amine oxidase of clade 1a (CuAOα1) was associated with natural variation in the amount of RGI present in the outer mucilage layer; cuaoα1 mutants validated its role in pectin production.",epidermal cells,Yes,
Q3-4,seedev_train_237,Is_Localized_In,Pathway,production of mucilage,Tissue,"Plants invest a lot of their resources into the production of an extracellular matrix built of polysaccharides. While the composition of the cell wall is relatively well characterized, the functions of the individual polymers and the enzymes that catalyze their biosynthesis remain poorly understood. We exploited the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed coat epidermis (SCE) to study cell wall synthesis. SCE cells produce mucilage, a specialized secondary wall that is rich in pectin, at a precise stage of development. A coexpression search for MUCILAGE-RELATED (MUCI) genes identified MUCI10 as a key determinant of mucilage properties. MUCI10 is closely related to a fenugreek (Trigonella foenumgraecum) enzyme that has in vitro galactomannan α-1,6-galactosyltransferase activity. Our detailed analysis of the muci10 mutants demonstrates that mucilage contains highly branched galactoglucomannan (GGM) rather than unbranched glucomannan. MUCI10 likely decorates glucomannan, synthesized by CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE A2, with galactose residues in vivo. The degree of galactosylation is essential for the synthesis of the GGM backbone, the structure of cellulose, mucilage density, as well as the adherence of pectin.",SCE cells,Yes,
Q3-5,seedev_train_237,Is_Localized_In,Pathway,production of mucilage,Tissue,"Arabidopsis seeds rapidly release hydrophilic polysaccharides from the seed coat on imbibition. These form a heavy mucilage layer around the seed that makes it sink in water. Fourteen natural Arabidopsis variants from central Asia and Scandinavia were identified with seeds that have modified mucilage release and float. Four of these have a novel mucilage phenotype with almost none of the released mucilage adhering to the seed and the absence of cellulose microfibrils. Mucilage release was modified in the variants by ten independent causal mutations in four different loci. Seven distinct mutations affected one locus, coding the MUM2 β-D-galactosidase, and represent a striking example of allelic heterogeneity. The modification of mucilage release has thus evolved a number of times independently in two restricted geographical zones. All the natural mutants identified still accumulated mucilage polysaccharides in seed coat epidermal cells. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry their production and retention was shown to reduce water mobility into internal seed tissues during imbibition, which would help to maintain seed buoyancy. Surprisingly, despite released mucilage being an excellent hydrogel it did not increase the rate of water uptake by internal seed tissues and is more likely to play a role in retaining water around the seed.",epidermal cells,Yes,

The AP-2 type transcription factors from various plant species have been classified into three major lineages (Kim et al., 2006), and WRI1 and two other related factors [WRI1/ASML1-related Two-1 (WAT1; At1g16060) and -2 (WAT2; At1g79700)] of Arabidopsis are in the lineage different from the ANT lineage.

To identify RUM1-dependent gene expression patterns, RNA-Seq of the differentiation zone of primary roots of rum1 mutants and the wild type was performed in four biological replicates. In total, 2 801 high-confidence maize genes displayed differential gene expression with Fc ≥2 and FDR ≤1%. The auxin signalling-related genes rum1, like-auxin1 (lax1), lax2, (nam ataf cuc 1 nac1), the plethora genes plt1 (plethora 1), bbm1 (baby boom 1), and hscf1 (heat shock complementing factor 1) and the auxin response factors arf8 and arf37 were down-regulated in the mutant rum1. All of these genes except nac1 were auxin-inducible. The maize arf8 and arf37 genes are orthologues of Arabidopsis MP/ARF5 (MONOPTEROS/ARF5), which controls the differentiation of vascular cells.

Q4-3,seedev_train_799,Is_Localized_In,Protein,PLT1,Tissue,"Roots play important roles in plant survival and productivity as they not only anchor the plants in the soil but are also the primary organ for the uptake of nutrients from the outside. The growth and development of roots depend on the specification and maintenance of the root meristem. Here, we report a previously unknown role of TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) in controlling root meristem size in Arabidopsis. The results showed that loss of function of TIC reduced root meristem length and cell number by decreasing the competence of meristematic cells to divide. This was due to the repressed expression of PIN genes for decreased acropetal auxin transport in tic-2, leading to low auxin accumulation in the roots responsible for reduced root meristem, which was verified by exogenous application of indole-3-acetic acid. Downregulated expression of PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2, key transcription factors in mediating the patterning of the root stem cell niche, was also assayed in tic-2. Similar results were obtained with tic-2 and wild-type plants at either dawn or dusk.

Q4-4,seedev_train_799,Is_Localized_In,Protein,PLT1,Tissue,"Plant postembryonic development takes place in the meristems, where stem cells self-renew and produce daughter cells that differentiate and give rise to different organ structures. For the maintenance of meristems, the rate of differentiation of daughter cells must equal the generation of new cells: How this is achieved is a central question in plant development. In the Arabidopsis root meristem, stem cells surround a small group of organizing cells, the quiescent center. Together they form a stem cell niche [1, 2], whose position and activity depends on the combinatorial action of two sets of genes - PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLETHORA2 (PLT2)[3, 4] and SCARECROW (SCR) and SHORTROOT (SHR)[2] - as well as on polar auxin transport. In contrast, the mechanisms controlling meristematic cell differentiation remain unclear.

Here, we report the identification of CBL, a gene required for embryo and root development in Arabidopsis, and encodes cystathionine beta-lyase (CBL), which catalyzes the penultimate step in methionine (Met) biosynthesis, and which also led to the discovery of a previous unknown, but crucial, metabolic contribution by the Met biosynthesis pathway. CBL is expressed in embryos and shows quiescent center (QC)-enriched expression pattern in the root. cbl mutant has impaired embryo patterning, defective root stem cell niche, stunted root growth, and reduces accumulation of the root master regulators PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2. Furthermore, mutation in CBL severely decreases abundance of several PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins and impairs auxin-responsive gene expression in the root tip. cbl seedlings also exhibit global reduction in histone H3 Lys-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and DNA methylation. Importantly, mutation in CBL reduces the abundance of H3K4me3 modification in PLT1/2 genes and downregulates their expression.",PLETHORA1,No,"Plethora 1 is what PLT1 stands for, not new information."

Transcripts for PPAR gamma, ADD1, and aP2 were localized in porcine subcutaneous and perirenal adipose tissues; transcripts for C/EBP alpha and LPL were detected in other tissues, but the greatest concentrations were in the adipose tissues. In porcine stromal-vascular cells (S/V cells) differentiating in vitro, transcripts for PPAR gamma and aP2 increased gradually, transcripts for ADD1, and LPL increased early and transcripts for C/EBP alpha increased late. In pigs, adipose tissue transcripts for PPAR gamma, ADD1, and LPL were minimal at birth and increased to 28 days postpartum, transcripts for C/EBP alpha were low until 28 days and transcripts for aP2 were at high levels, regardless of age.",pig tissues,No,Best answer in paragraph includes porcine subcutaneous and perirenal adipose tissues.

Q5-3,seedev_dev_176,Is_Localized_In,RNA,AP2 transcripts,Tissue,"Rapamycin (Sirolimus) is a potent immunosuppressive drug that reduces renal transplant rejection. Hyperlipidemia is a significant side effect of rapamycin treatment, and frequently leads to cardiovascular disease. Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2) is a member of the cytoplasmic fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family. aP2 has been shown to affect insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, lipolysis, and has recently been shown to play an important role in atherosclerosis. We found that aP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased in human THP-1 cells after rapamycin treatment. Exposure of human differentiated THP-1 cells to rapamycin led to a time- and dose-dependent induction of aP2 mRNA expression. While aP2 expression was undetectable in undifferentiated THP-1 cells, aP2 was induced in these cells by rapamycin.

We show here that in addition to its functions during flower development, AP2 activity is also required during seed development. We isolated the AP2 gene and found that it encodes a putative nuclear protein that is distinguished by an essential 68-amino acid repeated motif, the AP2 domain. Consistent with its genetic functions, we determined that AP2 is expressed at the RNA level in all four types of floral organs--sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels--and in developing ovules. Thus, AP2 gene transcription does not appear to be spatially restricted by the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS as predicted by previous studies. We also found that AP2 is expressed at the RNA level in the inflorescence meristem and in nonfloral organs, including leaf and stem.
