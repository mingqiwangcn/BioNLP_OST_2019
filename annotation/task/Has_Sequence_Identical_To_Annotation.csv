Despite initiation of the autophagy-lysosomal system, autophagic clearance was found ineffective which is in agreement with the formation of autophagic vacuoles. This report identifies woozy muscle as a faithful phenocopy of the MSS myopathy. Moreover, we provide a link between two well-established disease mechanisms in skeletal muscle, dysfunction of chaperones and nuclear envelope pathology.",BiP,No,SIL1 activates BiP by exchanging its factor to the active form; they are not equivalent proteins.
Q1-2,seedev_train_930,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Gene,SIL1,Gene,"Finally, these results were confirmed and extended in three human EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from individuals with MSS, leading us to conclude that the BiP cofactor Sil1 is dispensable for antibody production.",BiP,No,"Cofactors, not equivalent."
Q1-3,seedev_train_930,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Gene,SIL1,Gene,"Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS) is a rare, early onset, autosomal recessive multisystem disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, cataracts and myopathy. Most MSS cases are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding SIL1, a nucleotide exchange factor for the molecular chaperone BiP which is essential for correct protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Woozy mice carrying a spontaneous Sil1 mutation recapitulate key pathological features of MSS, including cerebellar atrophy with degeneration of Purkinje cells and progressive myopathy. Because the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response is activated in degenerating neurons of woozy mice, and inhibiting PERK-mediated translational attenuation has shown protective effects in protein-misfolding neurodegenerative disease models, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of GSK2606414, a potent inhibitor of PERK. Mice were chronically treated with GSK2606414 starting from a presymptomatic stage, and the effects were evaluated on biochemical, histopathological and clinical readouts. GSK2606414 delayed Purkinje cell degeneration and the onset of motor deficits, prolonging the asymptomatic phase of the disease; it also reduced the skeletal muscle abnormalities and improved motor performance during the symptomatic phase.",a nucleotide exchange factor for the molecular chaperone BiP,Yes,SIL1 is by definition the nucleotide exchange factor for BiP; these are equivalent.

We suggest that this motif constitutes a natural metal-oxide binding archetype that could be exploited in enzyme-based biofuel cell design and approaches to synthesize tailored metal-oxide nanostructures.,Thalassiosira pseudonana,No,"Thalassiosira pseudonana is the organism studied, not a gene."
Q1-5,seedev_train_930,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Gene,SIL1,Gene,"Secretory and cell membrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where a network of molecular chaperones and folding factors ensure correct protein folding and export to post-ER compartments. Failure of this process leads to accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins, ER stress, and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex signalling pathway aimed at restoring ER homeostasis, whose failure eventually leads to cell death. SIL1 is a nucleotide exchange factor for BiP, the main ER chaperone and primary sensor of ER stress. Loss of SIL1 function causes Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS), a rare multisystem disease of early infancy for which there is no cure. This review, examines the current understanding of SIL1 activities in the ER, and reviews experimental data describing the consequences of SIL1 deficiency in cell and animal models. We discuss the evidence supporting a role of the UPR -particularly the PERK branch - in the pathogenesis of MSS, and how this may be pharmacologically manipulated for treatment.",BiP,No,SIL1 activates BiP by exchanging its factor to the active form; they are not equivalent proteins.
Q2-1,seedev_dev_165,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Protein_Family,ethylene responsive element binding protein,Protein_Family,"An oilseed rape (Brassica napus H) cDNA microarray containing 8095 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was used to analyze the B. napus gene expression changes elicited by oligochitosan. Transcript levels for 393 genes were altered twofold or more in oligochitosan-treated seedlings compared to control seedlings. Of the 393 genes, 257 were repressed and 136 were induced. Semi quantification RT-PCR of eight of these 393 genes confirmed the microarray results. These 393 genes were involved in different processes and had different functions including defense, primary metabolism, transcription, and signal transduction etc. Some of these genes were elicited by various pathogen-related or stress stimuli, and others were regulated by plant growth regulators like auxin and gibberellin. These manifested complicated interactions of oligochitosan and phytohormones. An important jasmonic acid (JA) synthase (2-oxophytodienoate-10,11-reductase) gene, a JA-mediated defense required kinase ATMPK4-homolog gene, an ethylene receptor gene, and two ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) genes were induced by oligochitosan, suggesting that oligochitosan activated the plant self-defense through JA/ET signaling pathway.",(EREBP),Yes,
Q2-2,seedev_dev_165,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Protein_Family,ethylene responsive element binding protein,Protein_Family,"The plant gaseous hormone ethylene regulates many aspects of plant growth, development and responses to the environment. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a transcription factor involved in the ethylene signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. To gain a better understanding of the ethylene signal transduction pathway in rice, six EIN3-like genes (designated OsEIL1-6) were identified. OsEIL1, which showed highest similarity with EIN3, was isolated and functionally characterized. Ectopic expression of OsEIL1 in Arabidopsis can partially complement the ein3-1 mutant. The transgenic rice plants with overexpression of OsEIL1 exhibit short root, coiled primary root and slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene. OsEBP89, an ethylene responsive element binding protein (EREBP) and OsACO1, an ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) oxidase gene were enhanced in the OsEIL1 overexpressing transgenic plants. These results indicate that OsEIL1 is involved in ethylene signal transduction pathway and acts as a positive regulator of ethylene response in rice.",(EREBP),Yes,

Analysis of the AP2-EREBP APETALA2-Ethylene Responsive Element Binding Protein (AP2-EREBP), NAC (NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF1, 2 (Arabidopsis transcription activation factor), CUC (cup-shaped cotyledon)), and WRKY families, known to be important in defense signaling, revealed changes and phylogenetic rearrangements relative to common bean and soybean that suggest these groups may have evolved different functions.

AP2/EREBP genes are divided into two subfamilies: AP2 genes with two AP2 domains and EREBP genes with a single AP2/ERF (Ethylene Responsive Element Binding Factor) domain. Based on previous phylogenetic analyses, AP2 genes can be divided into two clades, AP2 and ANT groups. To clarify the molecular evolution of the AP2 subfamily, we isolated and sequenced genes with two AP2 domains from three gymnosperms, Cycas revoluta, Ginkgo biloba, and Gnetum parvifolium,as well as from the moss Physcomitrella patens. Expressions of AP2-like genes, including AP2, in Arabidopsis thaliana are regulated by the microRNA miR172. We found that the target site of miR172 is significantly conserved in gymnosperm AP2 homologs, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms of gene expression using microRNA have been conserved over the three hundred million years since the divergence of gymnosperm and flowering plant lineages. We inferred a phylogenetic relationship of these genes with the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and seed-plant genes available in public DNA databases.",AP2 (APETALA2)/EREBP,Yes,
Q2-5,seedev_dev_165,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Protein_Family,ethylene responsive element binding protein,Protein_Family,"Gene expression patterns covering over 10,000 seed-expressed sequences were analyzed by macroarray technology in maternal tissue (mainly pericarp) and filial endosperm and embryo during barley seed development from anthesis until late maturation. Defined sets of genes showing distinct expression patterns characterized both tissue type and major developmental phases. The analysis focused on regulatory networks involved in programmed cell death (PCD) and abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated maturation. These processes were similar in the different tissues, but typically involved the expression of alternative members of a common gene family. The analysis of co-expressed gene sets and the identification of cis regulatory elements in orthologous rice gene 'promoter' regions suggest that PCD in the pericarp is mediated by distinct classes of proteases and is under the hormonal control of both jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene via ethylene-responsive element binding protein (EREBP) transcription factors (TFs). On the other hand, PCD in endosperm apparently involves only the ethylene pathway, but employs distinct gene family members from those active in the pericarp, and a different set of proteases and TFs. JA biosynthetic genes are hardly activated. Accordingly, JA levels are high in the pericarp but low in the endosperm during middle and late developmental stages.",(EREBP),Yes,
Q3-1,seedev_train_142,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Gene,LEC2,Gene,"The transcription factor LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2; At1g28300) is preferentially expressed in developing seeds of Arabidopsis. Detailed biochemical analysis of a loss-of-function lec2 mutant was carried out in seeds 6-21 days after flowering (DAF). In comparison to wild type controls, lec2 seeds had 15% less protein and 30% less oil, but accumulated 140% more sucrose and >5-fold more starch. We also quantified biomass and carbohydrates in the seed coat and embryo. The lec2 mutant had smaller seeds and an altered proportion of dry weight (bigger seed coat and smaller embryos). Mutant plants produced less mature seeds per silique and the harvest index was reduced. Soluble sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) was accumulated in the seed coat of the lec2 mutant, whereas the opposite effect was observed in the embryos (decrease in comparison to wild type). The rate of starch synthesis increased during early development, whereas the rate of starch degradation was diminished during late development, leading to higher residual starch in mature seed of the mutant. Starch accumulated in both seed coat and embryo.",LEAFY COTYLEDON 2,Yes,
Q3-2,seedev_train_142,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Gene,LEC2,Gene,"The low lipid content is one of the major bottlenecks to realize the industrialization of the algae biodiesel. Improvement of lipid content through global regulation to get high-yield generating algae is a good strategy. Leafy Cotyledon 2 (LEC2) is an important transcription factor for seed maturation and oil accumulation in Arabidopsis. However, there are few reports regarding adoption of LEC2 for lipid accumulation until now. In this study, LEC2 from Arabidopsis was cloned into the plant expression vector pCIMBIA1300 and transformed into C. sorokiniana through particle bombardment. One recombinant was screened by PCR, RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Compared with the wild type one, the total lipid content in the recombinant increased one fold, which did not show effect on cell growth, indicating that LEC2 can efficiently enhance the lipid accumulation in C. sorokiniana.",Leafy Cotyledon 2,Yes,
Q3-3,seedev_train_142,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Gene,LEC2,Gene,"In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), transcriptional control of seed maturation involves three related regulators with a B3 domain, namely LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2), ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), and FUSCA3 (ABI3/FUS3/LEC2 [AFLs]). Although genetic analyses have demonstrated partially overlapping functions of these regulators, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained elusive. The results presented here confirmed that the three proteins bind RY DNA elements (with a 5'-CATG-3' core sequence) but with different specificities for flanking nucleotides. In planta as in the moss Physcomitrella patens protoplasts, the presence of RY-like (RYL) elements is necessary but not sufficient for the regulation of the OLEOSIN1 (OLE1) promoter by the B3 AFLs. G box-like domains, located in the vicinity of the RYL elements, also are required for proper activation of the promoter, suggesting that several proteins are involved. Consistent with this idea, LEC2 and ABI3 showed synergistic effects on the activation of the OLE1 promoter.",LEAFY COTYLEDON2,Yes,
Q3-4,seedev_train_142,Has_Sequence_Identical_To,Gene,LEC2,Gene,"Embryogenesis in flowering plants is controlled by a complex interplay of genetic, biochemical, and physiological regulators. LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) is among a small number of key transcriptional regulators that are known to play important roles in controlling major events during the maturation stage of embryogenesis, notably, the synthesis and accumulation of storage reserves. LEC2 overexpression causes vegetative tissues to change their developmental fate to an embryonic state; however, little information exists about the cellular changes that take place. We show that LEC2 alters leaf morphology and anatomy and causes embryogenic structures to form subcellularly in leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Chloroplasts accumulate more starch, the cytoplasm fills with oil bodies, and lytic vacuoles (LVs) appear smaller in size and accumulate protein deposits. Because LEC2 is responsible for activating the synthesis of seed storage proteins (SSPs) during seed development, SSP accumulation was investigated in leaves. The major Arabidopsis SSP families were shown to accumulate within small leaf vacuoles. By exploiting the developmental and tissue-specific localization of two tonoplast intrinsic protein isoforms, the small leaf vacuoles were identified as protein storage vacuoles (PSVs).",LEAFY COTYLEDON2,Yes,

In an attempt to understand the developmental control of storage product accumulation, we observed the expression time course of the five transcripts. The sequential expression of these factors during seed fill suggests differentiation of their normal responsibilities. By extending the expression periods of the two early genes LEC1 and LEC2 in transgenic seeds, we demonstrated that the subsequent timing of FUS3, ABI3, and ABI5 transcripts depends on LEC1 and LEC2. Because a delayed onset or reduced level of FUS3 mRNA coincided with reduction of seed oil content in the transgenic seeds, the role of FUS3 in oil deposition was further examined. Analysis of published seed transcriptome data indicated that FUS3 transcript increased together with nearly all the plastidial fatty acid biosynthetic transcripts during development.",LEAFY COTYLEDON2,Yes,

A two-hybrid screen in yeast identified three proteins that interacted specifically with AfVP1 (AfVP1 interacting proteins; AfVIPs). AfVIPs 2 and 3 interacted with the C-terminus of AfVP1, which contains the B2 + B3 domains, previously shown to bind DNA, whereas AfVIP1 interacted with the isolated B3 domain. Using purified proteins in in vitro experiments, all three AfVIPs were shown also to interact with the Arabidopsis homologue ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3). The three AfVIPs were expressed in both dormant and non-dormant embryos, but the abundance of AfVIP1 and 3 transcripts was greater in germinated than dormant seeds, whereas transcripts of AfVIP2 (and AfVP1) were more highly expressed in dormant embryos.",Arabidopsis,No,Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is the organism studied.

There is also tremendous interest in using seeds as a sustainable alternative to fossil reserves for green chemistry. Seeds accumulate large amounts of storage compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins and oils. It would be useful for agro-industrial purposes to produce seeds that accumulate these storage compounds more specifically and at higher levels. The main metabolic pathways necessary for oil, starch or protein accumulation are well characterized. However, the overall regulation of partitioning between the various pathways remains unclear. Such knowledge could provide new molecular tools for improving the qualities of crop seeds (Focks and Benning, 1998, Plant Physiol. 118, 91). Studies to improve understanding of the genetic controls of seed development and metabolism therefore remain a key area of research. In the model plant Arabidopsis, genetic analyses have demonstrated that LEAFY COTYLEDON genes, namely LEC1, LEC2 and FUSCA3 (FUS3), are key transcriptional regulators of seed maturation, together with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3).

In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were used here to study the regulation of Pisum sativum psp54, which codes for the precursor of a chromatin-associated protein in dry seeds. Antibodies against PsSNF5, a component of the SWI/SNF remodelling complex, and against the transcriptional factor Pisum sativum abscisic acid insensitive 3 (PsABI3) were raised and used for ChIP experiments, which showed that both factors are bound to the psp54 promoter only when the gene is actively expressed during seed maturation and germination. However, RNA polymerase II appeared to be bound to the inactive promoter, which was poised for transcription, before the assembly of factors. Micrococcal nuclease protection assays showed that chromatin conformation at the proximal psp54 promoter changes in shifting from the active to inactive state. The changes in the promoter chromatin of psp54 are discussed.

The study measured stress by using heart rate variability analysis for 30 min postfeeding in the morning and 30 min postexercise after a morning training session. The study found no significant difference at rest between the REC and DRES horses. During the posttraining measurements, however, the DRES horses showed, among others, a less sympathetic and increased parasympathetic dominance.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 64 African American and White men from diverse backgrounds, aged 40 to 64, from North Carolina. Regardless of race or education, men experienced DREs more negatively than colonoscopies because penetration with a finger was associated with a gay sexual act. Some men disliked colonoscopies, however, because they associated any penetration as an affront to their masculinity. Because beliefs did not differ by race, future research should focus on structural issues to examine why disparities persist with prostate and colorectal cancer.

However, linking common variants to genes that are causal for CKD etiology remains challenging. By adapting self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing, we evaluated the effect of genetic variation on DNA regulatory elements (DREs). Variants in linkage with the CKD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11959928 were shown to affect DRE function, illustrating that genes regulated by DREs colocalizing with CKD-associated variation can be dysregulated and therefore, considered as CKD candidate genes. To identify target genes of these DREs, we used circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) sequencing on glomerular endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells. Our 4C analyses revealed interactions of CKD-associated susceptibility regions with the transcriptional start sites of 304 target genes. Overlap with multiple databases confirmed that many of these target genes are involved in kidney homeostasis. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed that mRNA levels of many target genes are genotype dependent.

Stimulation occurs when the element is located upstream, but not downstream, the transcription initiation site. Activation requires both Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands and the leucine-charged domains (LCDs), analogous to those responsible for the interaction of the nuclear receptors with coregulators. Further more, DREAM can bind both 'in vitro' and in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to these elements. Importantly, 'in vivo' binding is only observed in vitamin D- or RA-treated cells.
