Q1-1,agac_task3_136,REG,Gene,PDGFRB,Disease,"Mutations were particularly associated with severe multicentric disease (13 of 19 myofibromatosis cases [68%]). Although patients had no familial history, 3 of 25 mutations (12%) were likely to be germline, suggesting de novo heritable alterations. All of the PDGFRB mutations were associated with ligand-independent receptor activation, and all but one were sensitive to imatinib at clinically relevant concentrations. Gain-of-function mutations of PDGFRB in myofibromas may affect only children and be more frequent in the multicentric form of disease, albeit present in solitary pediatric myofibromas. These alterations may be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The PDGFRB sequencing appears to have a high value for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of soft-tissue tumors in children.",multicentric disease,No,Multicentric is describing a characteristic of some myofibromatosis cases. Best answer here includes myofibromatosis.
Q1-2,agac_task3_136,REG,Gene,PDGFRB,Disease,"The two known types of pathogenic variants (p.(Pro584Arg) and p.(Trp566Arg)) of the PDGFRB that cause KOGS are exclusively located in the juxtaglomerular domain that regulates autoactivation/inhibition of PDGFRB. In-vitro evidence suggests that p.(Pro584Arg) represents a gain-of-function pathogenic variant. Inhibition of PDGFRB activity using multi-kinase inhibitors appears to be a potentially promising therapeutic approach. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease using induced pluripotent stem cells is under way. Presence of skeletal overgrowth, distinctive facial features, characteristic hyperelastic and fragile skin, and cerebral white matter lesions with neuropsychiatric symptoms should prompt genetic analysis of the PDGFRB.",KOGS,Yes,
Q1-3,agac_task3_136,REG,Gene,PDGFRB,Disease,"From a functional standpoint, hypermorphic mutations in PDGFRB lead to Kosaki overgrowth syndrome, infantile myofibromatosis (OMIM #228550), and Penttinen syndrome (OMIM #601812), whereas hypomorphic mutations lead to idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (OMIM #615007). In conclusion, a specific class of mutations in PDGFRB causes a clinically recognizable syndromic form of skeletal overgrowth.",Kosaki overgrowth syndrome,Yes,
Q1-4,agac_task3_136,REG,Gene,PDGFRB,Disease,"Heterozygous activating mutations in platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB) have been recently identified as a cause of autosomal-dominant infantile myofibromatosis. We describe a 36-year-old man with PDGFRB c.1681C>T (p.R561C) mutation. Upon progressive disease, the patient received treatment with imatinib and showed a remarkable response with remission of multiple lesions after 12 months. This is the first report of an adult patient with PDGFRB c.1681C>T mutation treated with imatinib.",autosomal-dominant infantile myofibromatosis.,Yes,
Q1-5,agac_task3_136,REG,Gene,PDGFRB,Disease,"We report a considerable number of cells in the ventricular and the subventricular zones (SVZ) of newborn mice to stain positive for the PDGF beta-receptor (PDGFRB). Many of them also stained for nestin and/or GFAP but less frequently for the neuroblast marker doublecortin and for the mitotic marker Ki-67. The SVZ of mice with nestin-Cre conditional deletion of PDGFRB expressed the receptor only on blood vessels and was devoid of any morphological abnormality. PDGFRB(-/-) neurospheres showed a higher rate of apoptosis without any significant decrease in proliferation. They demonstrated reduced capacities of migration and neuronal differentiation in response to not only PDGF-BB but also bFGF. Furthermore, the PDGFR kinase inhibitor STI571 blocked the effects of bFGF in control neurosphere cultures. bFGF increased the activity of the PDGFRB promoter as well as the expression and phosphorylation of PDGFRB. These results suggest the presence of the signaling convergence between PDGF and FGF. PDGFRB is needed for survival, and the effects of bFGF in migration and neural differentiation of the cells may be potentiated by induction of PDGFRB.",apoptosis,Yes,
Q2-1,agac_task3_146,REG,Gene,ATXN2,Disease,"To analyze the clinical and genetic features of a family with Parkinson's disease caused by expansion of CAG triplet repeat in the ATXN2 gene. The CAG/CAA repeat in the ATXN2 gene was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Molecular testing has documented a pathological heterozygous expansion of the CAG repeat from 33 to 35 in 6 patients and other 8 family members. Two patients had pure CAG triplet repeat expansion in their ATXN2 gene, while others had CAA interruption. Expanded CAG/CAA repeat in the ATXN2 gene is the causative mutation of the disease in this family.The 8 members with expanded CAG/CAA repeat may be asymptomatic patients. It is supposed that the number and configuration of the ATXN2 CAG/CAA repeat expansion may play an important role in the phenotypic variability of Parkinson's disease.",Parkinson's disease,Yes,
Q2-2,agac_task3_146,REG,Gene,ATXN2,Disease,"Megakaryopoiesis is the process during which megakaryoblasts differentiate to polyploid megakaryocytes that can subsequently shed thousands of platelets in the circulation. Megakaryocytes accumulate mRNA during their maturation, which is required for the correct spatio-temporal production of cytoskeletal proteins, membranes and platelet-specific granules, and for the subsequent shedding of thousands of platelets per cell. Gene expression profiling identified the RNA binding protein ATAXIN2 (ATXN2) as a putative novel regulator of megakaryopoiesis. ATXN2 expression is high in CD34+/CD41+ megakaryoblasts and sharply decreases upon maturation to megakaryocytes. ATXN2 associates with DDX6 suggesting that it may mediate repression of mRNA translation during early megakaryopoiesis. Comparative transcriptome and proteome analysis on megakaryoid cells (MEG-01) with differential ATXN2 expression identified ATXN2 dependent gene expression of mRNA and protein involved in processes linked to hemostasis.",hemostasis,No,"Hemostasis is not a disease, rather a normal and necessary part of cells."
Q2-3,agac_task3_146,REG,Gene,ATXN2,Disease,"Finally, it has been shown that ATXN2 with non-pathogenic intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeat elongations (encoding the polyglutamine tract) is a genetic risk factor of ALS. Considering the similarities in the disease phenotype and the neuropathological link between ALS and HSP we hypothesized that intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 could be a modulator of HSP. We show that in a cohort of 181 HSP patients 4.9 % of the patients had intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 which was not significantly different from the frequencies in a Danish control cohort or in American and European control populations. However, the mean age of onset was significantly lower in HSP patients with intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 compared to patients with normal length repeats. Based on these results we conclude that ATXN2 is most likely not a risk factor of HSP, whereas it might serve as a modulator of age of onset.",ALS,Yes,
Q2-4,agac_task3_146,REG,Gene,ATXN2,Disease,"Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) is implicated mainly in mRNA processing. Some ATXN2 associates with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), inhibiting their endocytic internalization through interaction of proline-rich domains (PRD) in ATXN2 with SH3 motifs in Src. Gain of function of ATXN2 leads to neuronal atrophy in the diseases spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Conversely, ATXN2 knockout (KO) mice show hypertrophy and insulin resistance. To elucidate the influence of ATXN2 on trophic regulation, we surveyed interactions of ATXN2 with SH3 motifs from numerous proteins and observed a novel interaction with Grb2. Direct binding in glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins indicated a physiologically relevant association. In SCA2 patient fibroblasts, Grb2 more than Src protein levels were diminished, with an upregulation of both transcripts suggesting enhanced protein turnover. In KO mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEF), the protein levels of Grb2 and Src were decreased.",neuronal atrophy,Yes,Also correct answers would be hypertrophy and insulin resistance. These are symptoms of larger diseases.
Q2-5,agac_task3_146,REG,Gene,ATXN2,Disease,"Within this region, a TAC risk haplotype comprising one SNP in SH2B3 gene (rs3184504) and two SNPs in ATXN2 gene (rs10774625 and rs653178) exhibited the strongest association with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome (p-value = 5,9 × 10(-4) OR 95% CI 1.84 (1.32-2.55)). The presence of a TAC risk haplotype in ATXN2-SH2B3 locus may contribute to increased thrombotic risk in aPLA carriers.",thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome,Yes,
Q3-1,agac_task3_42,REG,Gene,CDH1,Disease,"CDH1 is a protein encoded by the CDH1 gene in humans. Mutations in this gene are linked with several types of cancer. Loss of CDH1 function contributes to the progression of cancer by increasing proliferation, invasion, and/or metastasis. However, the association between and clinicopathological significance of CDH1 promoter methylation and lung cancer remains unclear. In this study, we systematically reviewed the studies of CDH1 promoter methylation and lung cancer, and evaluated the association between CDH1 promoter methylation and lung cancer using meta-analysis methods. A comprehensive search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed up to July 2014. The methodological quality of the studies was also evaluated. The data were extracted and assessed by two reviewers independently. Analyses of pooled data were performed. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated and summarized. Finally, an analysis of 866 patients with non-small cell lung cancer from 13 eligible studies was performed. The CDH1 methylation level in the cancer group was significantly higher than in the controls (OR 3.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.87-5.27, P<0.00001).",cancer,Yes,
Q3-2,agac_task3_42,REG,Gene,CDH1,Disease,Germline mutations in the E-cadherin gene CDH1 have recently been described that seem to be responsible for the development of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. The world literature on familial gastric cancer is reviewed in terms of mutations of the E-cadherin gene CDH1. There are reports of 18 families worldwide with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer due to germline mutations of the E-cadherin gene CDH1. Germline mutations of the E-cadherin gene CDH1 lead to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer with a penetrance of about 70%. An early onset with an average age of 38 years in men and women is typical for this autosomal dominant inherited disease. Until now preventive total gastrectomies with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer have been reported in five patients. Preventive total gastrectomy should be the procedure of choice in patients with a germline mutation of the E-cadherin gene CDH1. Patients with a genetic risk for familial gastric cancer who reject preventive total gastrectomy must be followed-up intensively by endoscopy every 6-12 months.,hereditary diffuse gastric cancer,Yes,
Q3-3,agac_task3_42,REG,Gene,CDH1,Disease,Inactivating mutations in the CDH1 (E-cadherin) gene are the predisposing cause of gastric cancer in most families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). The lifetime risk of cancer in mutation positive members is more than 80 % and prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended. Not all mutations in the CDH1 gene are however pathogenic and it is important to classify mutations before this major operation is performed. Probands from two Danish families with gastric cancer and a history suggesting HDGC were screened for CDH1 gene mutations. Two novel CDH1 gene mutations were identified and found pathogenic. In silico and mini-gene assay were used to predict the functional consequence in one of them. Mutation carriers were offered endoscopy and total gastrectomy. The gastric specimens were completely sectioned and examined histologically. Seven asymptomatic mutation carriers were operated. Hospital stay was 6-8 days and there were no complications. Small foci of diffuse gastric cancer were found in all patients-intramucosal in six and advanced in one. Preoperative endoscopic biopsies had revealed a microscopic cancer focus in two of the patients. Our data confirmed the pathogenic nature of both mutations and strongly support the recommendation of total gastrectomy in asymptomatic CDH1 gene mutation carriers.,gastric cancer,Yes,
Q3-4,agac_task3_42,REG,Gene,CDH1,Disease,"Germline point or small frameshift mutations of the CDH1 (E-cadherin) gene are known to cause familial gastric cancer (FGC), but the frequency of CDH1 mutations is low in Japanese patients with FGC. Because recent studies have reported germline large genomic deletions of CDH1 in European and Canadian patients with FGC, in the present study we examined DNA samples from 13 Japanese patients with FGC to determine whether similar germline changes were present in CDH1 in this population. Using a sequencing analysis, a 1-bp deletion (c.1212delC), leading to the production of a truncated protein (p.Asn405IlefsX12), was found in an FGC family; immunohistochemical analysis revealed the loss of CDH1 protein expression in the tumors in this family. Using a combination of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and RT-PCR analyses, we also found a large genomic deletion (c.164-?_387+?del), leading to the loss of exon 3 and the production of a truncated protein (p.Val55GlyfsX38), in another FGC family. The functional effects of the detected mutations were examined using a slow aggregation assay.",familial gastric cancer,Yes,
Q3-5,agac_task3_42,REG,Gene,CDH1,Disease,"Using genome-wide expression profiling of a panel of 27 human mammary cell lines with different mechanisms of E-cadherin inactivation, we evaluated the relationship between E-cadherin status and gene expression levels. Expression profiles of cell lines with E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter methylation were significantly different from those with CDH1 expression or, surprisingly, those with CDH1 truncating mutations. Furthermore, we found no significant differentially expressed genes between cell lines with wild-type and mutated CDH1. The expression profile complied with the fibroblastic morphology of the cell lines with promoter methylation, suggestive of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). All other lines, also the cases with CDH1 mutations, had epithelial features. Three non-tumorigenic mammary cell lines derived from normal breast epithelium also showed CDH1 promoter methylation, a fibroblastic phenotype and expression profile. We suggest that CDH1 promoter methylation, but not mutational inactivation, is part of an entire programme, resulting in EMT and increased invasiveness in breast cancer. The molecular events that are part of this programme can be inferred from the differentially expressed genes and include genes from the TGFbeta pathway, transcription factors involved in CDH1 regulation (i.e.",breast cancer,Yes,
Q4-1,agac_task3_88,REG,Gene,MED13L,Disease,"Cancer, in general, is considered a disease of genetic mutation. Many questions are, however, unanswered. How exactly do mutations occur in the cells? How do gene mutations interface with the cell microenvironment and macroenvironment to create cancer phenotypes? Is mutation the cause of cancer or the consequence of special adaptive responses to aging; hormonal imbalance; physical, chemical and biologic stresses and damage? What makes cancer spread in the body and invade other organs causing death to the patient? In this paper, we hypothesize that the cellular hyperexcitability via stimulation of mineral channels (e.g. sodium voltage-gated channels) and ligand excitatory receptors (e.g. glutamate and other neuron and non-neuronal excitatory receptors) could be a significant causative and pathogenic factor of cancer. Managing hyperexcitatory states of the cells through lifestyle, nutritional changes, phytochemical and pharmaceutical medications theoretically could be a prospective direction in cancer prevention and therapy.",Cancer,No,Subject not mentioned.
Q4-2,agac_task3_88,REG,Gene,MED13L,Disease,"The Mediator is a multiprotein transcriptional coactivator that is expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals and is required for induction of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription by DNA binding transcription factors. In the work described here, we exploit multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to carry out a proteomic analysis of the subunit composition of the mammalian Mediator complex. By comparing MudPIT data sets obtained from six independent Mediator preparations immunoaffinity purified through their Nut2 (MED10), Med25 (MED9), Intersex (MED29), LCMR1 (MED19), AK007855 (MED28), or CRSP70 (MED26) subunits, we identify a set of consensus mammalian Mediator subunits. In addition, we identify as Mediator-associated proteins the CDK8-like cyclin-dependent kinase CDK11 and the TRAP240-like KIAA1025 protein (MED13L), which is mutated in patients with the congenital heart defect transposition of the great arteries (TGA).",congenital heart defect,Yes,
Q4-3,agac_task3_88,REG,Gene,MED13L,Disease,"The effect of MED12 or MED13/MED13L depletion on cancer-acquired superenhancer gene expression was more specific than and partially distinct from that of BRD4 depletion, with the most efficient inhibition seen with combined targeting. These results identify a requirement of MED12 and MED13/MED13L for expression of acquired superenhancer genes in colon cancer, implicating these Mediator subunits as potential therapeutic targets for colon cancer, alone or together with BRD4.",colon cancer,Yes,
Q4-4,agac_task3_88,REG,Gene,MED13L,Disease,"The inherited movement disorders comprise a rapidly growing category of human disease. Advances in genetics have led to the identification of the gene mutation in Huntington's disease and three different gene mutations, which may lead to Parkinson's disease. In addition, gene mutations have been identified in less common movement disorders including Wilson's disease, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, paroxysmal kinesogenic choreoathetosis, neuroacanthocytosis, and some forms of dystonia. This article summarizes what is known about the genetic mutations that cause these movement disorders, as well as the clinical features of each disease and the symptomatic treatments currently available.",Parkinson's disease.,No,Subject not mentioned.

Q5-1,agac_task3_157,REG,Gene,PDGFRA,Disease,"Thirteen mutations were not reported before, and five (P577S, V658A, R841K, H845Y, and G853D) of them resulted in strong autophosphorylation of PDGFRA. Crenolanib showed higher potency than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of PDGFRA. Except that V658A mutation was imatinib-resistant, all the other mutations were sensitive to both imatinib and crenolanib. PDGFRA mutations are detected in a small population of melanoma patients. Our study suggests that patients with melanoma harboring certain PDGFRA mutations may benefit from imatinib and crenolanib treatment.",melanoma,Yes,
Q5-2,agac_task3_157,REG,Gene,PDGFRA,Disease,"KIT and PDGFRA in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) have been rarely examined in Japanese. The author investigated protein expression of KIT and PDGFRA in 54 Japanese cases of small cell lung carcinoma by immunohistochemistry, and gene mutations of KIT and PDGFRA in 20 Japanese cases of small cell lung carcinoma by the PCR-direct sequencing method. The molecular genetic analysis showed no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes in all 20 cases. KIT protein expression was recognized in all cases (100%). Membranous KIT expression was strong in 35 cases, moderate in 7 cases and weak in 12 cases. PDGFRA protein expression was noted in 35 cases (65%); the membranous expression was strong in 2 cases, moderate in 16 cases, and weak in 17 cases. The overall median survival was 13 months. There was no significant difference in the survival between KIT strongly positive cases (median, 12 months) and KIT moderately or weakly positive cases (median, 11 months). Likewise, there was no significant difference in the survival between PDGFRA-positive cases (median, 11 months) and PDGFRA-negative cases (median, 12 months). The protein expressions of KIT and PDGFRA did not correlate with gender, smoking, and disease stage.",small cell lung carcinoma,Yes,
Q5-3,agac_task3_157,REG,Gene,PDGFRA,Disease,"The FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion is seen in a fraction of cases with a presumptive diagnosis of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). However, because most HES patients lack FIP1L1-PDGFRA, we studied whether they harbor activating mutations of the PDGFRA gene. Sequencing of 87 FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative HES patients revealed several novel PDGFRA point mutations (R481G, L507P, I562M, H570R, H650Q, N659S, L705P, R748G, and Y849S). When cloned into 32D cells, N659S and Y849S and-on selection for high expressors-also H650Q and R748G mutants induced growth factor-independent proliferation, clonogenic growth, and constitutive phosphorylation of PDGFRA and Stat5. Imatinib antagonized Stat5 phosphorylation. Mutations involving positions 659 and 849 had been shown previously to possess transforming potential in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Because H650Q and R748G mutants possessed only weak transforming activity, we injected 32D cells harboring these mutants or FIP1L1-PDGFRA into mice and found that they induced a leukemia-like disease.",leukemia-like disease.,Yes,
Q5-4,agac_task3_157,REG,Gene,PDGFRA,Disease,"These findings suggest, in Japanese population, that mutations of KIT and PDGFRA were absent in small cell lung carcinoma of Japan, that KIT protein expression is present in 100%, that PDGFRA expression is present in 65%, and that KIT and PDGFRA protein expressions do not correlate with survival, gender, smoking, and disease stage.",small cell lung carcinoma,No,
Q5-5,agac_task3_157,REG,Gene,PDGFRA,Disease,"Activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) by genomic aberrations contributes to tumor progression in several tumor types. In this study, we characterize 16 novel PDGFRA mutations identified from different tumor types and identify three previously uncharacterized activating mutations that promote cell survival and proliferation. PDGFRA Y288C, an extracellular domain mutation, is primarily high mannose glycosylated consistent with trapping in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Strikingly, PDGFRA Y288C is constitutively dimerized and phosphorylated in the absence of ligand suggesting that trapping in the ER or aberrant glycosylation is sufficient for receptor activation. Importantly, PDGFRA Y288C induces constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and STAT3. PDGFRA Y288C is resistant to PDGFR inhibitors but sensitive to PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibitors consistent with pathway activation results. Our findings further highlight the importance of characterizing functional consequences of individual mutations for precision medicine.",tumor progression in several tumor types,Yes,
