Q1-1,seedev_train_527,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,KAPP,Protein_Complex,"Continuous growth and development in plants are accomplished by meristems, groups of undifferentiated cells that persist as stem cells and initiate organs. While the structures of the apical and floral meristems in dicotyledonous plants have been well described, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling cell proliferation and differentiation in these structures. We have shown previously that the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) gene in Arabidopsis encodes a receptor kinase-like protein that controls the size of the apical and floral meristems. Here, we show that KAPP, a gene encoding a kinase-associated protein phosphatase, is expressed in apical and young floral meristems, along with CLV1. Overexpression of KAPP mimics the clv1 mutant phenotype. Furthermore, CLV1 has kinase activity: it phosphorylates both itself and KAPP. Finally, KAPP binds and dephosphorylates CLV1. We present a model where KAPP functions as a negative regulator of the CLAVATA1 signal transduction pathway.",phosphatase,No,This paragraph uses KAPP to refer to the gene; the phosphatase mentioned is simply the protein that gene encodes.

Q1-3,seedev_train_527,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,KAPP,Protein_Complex,"In the intact rat myometrium, forskolin stimulated cyclic AMP generation and markedly potentiated increases in cyclic AMP caused by isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin. The diterpene increased the maximal responses and lowered the EC50 for both isoproterenol- and prostaglandin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Forskolin did not modify the Ki for the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Activation of cyclic AMP generation by forskolin was biphasic with respect to concentration; the major response being mediated by a low affinity interaction (Kapp 28 microM) and a minor effect being due to an interaction with a high affinity site (Kapp 0.5 microM). By contrast, the synergistic effect of the diterpene with isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2 as well as with cholera toxin, involved a single component of high affinity (Kapp 0.5 to 2 microM), which was thus considered to be associated with the activated complex of the cyclase catalytic subunit and the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Forskolin could further partially maintain isoproterenol-mediated synergism in a beta-adrenergic desensitized tissue.",guanine nucleotide regulatory protein,No,"This paragraph, like the previous one, is discussing Kapp, not KAPP. This is a dissociation constant and is not relevant to the protein addressed in the triple."
Q1-4,seedev_train_527,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,KAPP,Protein_Complex,"AtSERK1(T463A)-CFP and AtSERK1(3T-->A)-CFP proteins were partially sequestered intracellularly in the absence of KAPP-YFP protein, suggesting an active role for KAPP dephosphorylation of threonine residues in the AtSERK1 A-loop in receptor internalization. The interaction between the KAPP-CFP/YFP and AtSERK1-CFP/YFP fusion proteins was investigated with fluorescence spectral imaging microscopy (FSPIM). Our results show that AtSERK1-CFP and KAPP-YFP proteins are colocalized at the plasma membrane but only show fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) indicative of physical interaction in intracellular vesicles. These results suggest that KAPP is an integral part of the AtSERK1 endocytosis mechanism.","KAPP-YFP protein,",Yes,"The YFP is a phosphorescent tag on the KAPP protein, which is added in the experiment  and is not found in vivo, but KAPP-YFP is a protein complex composed primarily of KAPP."
Q1-5,seedev_train_527,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,KAPP,Protein_Complex,"FHA domains are phosphoThr recognition modules found in diverse signaling proteins, including kinase-associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) from Arabidopsis thaliana. The kinase-interacting FHA domain (KI-FHA) of KAPP targets it to function as a negative regulator of some receptor-like kinase (RLK) signaling pathways important in plant development and environmental responses. To aid in the identification of potential binding sites for the KI-FHA domain, we predicted (i) the structure of a representative KAPP-binding RLK, CLAVATA1, and (ii) the functional surfaces of RLK kinase domains using evolutionary trace analysis. We selected phosphopeptides from KAPP-binding Arabidopsis RLKs for in vitro studies of association with KI-FHA from KAPP. Three phosphoThr peptide fragments from the kinase domain of CLV1 or BAK1 were found to bind KI-FHA with KD values of 8-20 microM, by NMR or titration calorimetry. Their affinity is driven by favorable enthalpy and solvation entropy gain. Mutagenesis of these three threonine sites suggests Thr546 in the C-lobe of the BAK1 kinase domain to be a principal but not sole site of KI-FHA binding in vitro.",kinase-associated protein phosphatase,No,The most correct answer in this paragraph appears to be CLAVATA1 or CLV1. Kinase-associated protein phosphatase is simply what KAPP stands for and offers no new information.
Q2-1,seedev_train_511,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,CO-like,Protein_Complex,"In non-bolting plants, the bolting activator BvFT2 was completely downregulated whereas the repressor BvFT1 was upregulated which suggests that both genes acquire a CONSTANS (CO) like function in beet. Like CO, B and B2 proteins house CCT and BBX domains which, in contrast to CO are split between the two beet genes. We propose an alternative regulation of FT orthologs in beet that can be exploited to breed winter beets.",beet,No,"The beet is the organism where the protein is found, not a protein complex."
Q2-2,seedev_train_511,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,CO-like,Protein_Complex,"Flowering time is an important agronomic trait that coordinates the plant life cycle with regional adaptability and thereby impacts yield potentials for cereal crops. The CONSTANS (CO)-like gene family plays vital roles in the regulation of flowering time. CO-like proteins are typically divided into four phylogenetic groups in rice. Several genes from groups I, III, and IV have been functionally characterized, though little is known about the genes of group II in rice. We report the functional characterization in rice of a constitutive floral inhibitor, OsCOL16, encoding a group-II CO-like protein that delays flowering time and increases plant height and grain yield. Overexpression of OsCOL16 resulted in late heading under both long-day and short-day conditions. OsCOL16 expression exhibits a diurnal oscillation and serves as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity. We determined that OsCOL16 up-regulates the expression of the floral repressor Ghd7, leading to down-regulation of the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1. Moreover, genetic diversity and evolutionary analyses suggest that remarkable differences in flowering times correlate with two major alleles of OsCOL16. Our combined molecular biology and phylogeographic analyses revealed that OsCOL16 plays an important role in regulating rice photoperiodic flowering, allowing for environmental adaptation of rice.",rice,No,"As in the previous paragraph, rice is the organism studied, not a protein complex."
Q2-3,seedev_train_511,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,CO-like,Protein_Complex,"The boost protein expression has been done successfully by simple co-expression with a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)-like peptide in Escherichia coli. Frequently, overexpression of a recombinant protein fails to provide an adequate yield. In the study, we developed a simple and efficient system for overexpressing transgenic proteins in bacteria by co-expression with an LEA-like peptide. The design of this peptide was based on part of the primary structure of an LEA protein that is known hydrophilic protein to suppress aggregation of other protein molecules. In our system, the expression of the target protein was increased remarkably by co-expression with an LEA-like peptide consisting of only 11 amino acid residues. This could provide a practical method for producing recombinant proteins efficiently.",Escherichia coli,No,"Also an organism studied, not a protein complex."
Q2-4,seedev_train_511,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,CO-like,Protein_Complex,"Using a cell-based complementation assay, we tested the PCD-like proteins from T. intermedia and two additional bacteria, and found no evidence for PCD enzymatic activity. However, we discovered that heterologous co-expression of the PCD-like protein from Halothiobacillus neapolitanus with RuBisCO and GroELS in Escherichia coli increased the amount of soluble, assembled RuBisCO recovered from cell lysates compared with co-expression of RuBisCO with GroELS alone. We conclude that this conserved PCD-like protein, renamed here α-carboxysome RuBisCO assembly factor (or acRAF), is a novel RuBisCO chaperone integral to α-carboxysome function.",Escherichia coli,No,"Also an organism studied, not a protein complex."
Q2-5,seedev_train_511,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,CO-like,Protein_Complex,"Plants flower in an appropriate season to allow sufficient vegetative development and position flower development in favorable environments. In Arabidopsis, CONSTANS (CO) and FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1) promote flowering by inducing FLOWER LOCUS T (FT) expression in the long-day afternoon. The CO protein is present in the morning but could not activate FT expression due to unknown negative mechanisms, which prevent premature flowering before the day length reaches a threshold. Here, we report that TARGET OF EAT1 (TOE1) and related proteins interact with the activation domain of CO and CO-like (COL) proteins and inhibit CO activity. TOE1 binds to the FT promoter near the CO-binding site, and reducing TOE function results in a morning peak of the FT mRNA. In addition, TOE1 interacts with the LOV domain of FKF1 and likely interferes with the FKF1-CO interaction, resulting in partial degradation of the CO protein in the afternoon to prevent premature flowering.",(COL),No,"COL is simply an acronym of CO-like, not a new concept or a protein complex."
Q3-1,seedev_train_526,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,14-3-3ν,Protein_Complex,"Other SERK1 Complex Components The presence of the PP2C phosphatase KAPP, 14-3-3ν, and CDC48A in the SERK1 complex confirms previously obtained results using yeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro interaction studies (Rienties et al., 2005). Collectively, these proteins appear to be involved in dephosphorylation, protein interaction and membrane interaction, and protein degradation, respectively. It is likely that they represent receptor maintenance or trafficking functions. Previously, it was shown that SERK1 could interact with 14-3-3λ (Rienties et al., 2005). The results presented here suggest that the receptor preferentially interacts with 14-3-3ν in seedlings and perhaps with 14-3-3λ in siliques, given the origin of the Arabidopsis cDNA library from young silique tissue that was used for yeast two-hybrid screening. The kinase domain of SERK1 is able to transphosphorylate and bind in vitro to CDC48A, 14-3-3λ, and KAPP (Rienties et al., 2005). In vitro, the interactions are all phosphorylation-dependent.",SERK1 complex,Yes,
Q3-2,seedev_train_526,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,14-3-3ν,Protein_Complex,"One of the proteins that is found in a diverse range of eukaryotic protein-protein interactions is the adaptor protein 14-3-3. As 14-3-3 is a hub protein with very diverse interactions, it is a good model to study various protein-protein interactions. A wide range of classes of molecules, peptides, small molecules or natural products, has been used to modify the protein interactions, providing both stabilization or inhibition of the interactions of 14-3-3 with its binding partners. The first protein crystal structures were solved in 1995 and gave molecular insights for further research. The plant analog of 14-3-3 binds to a plant plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase and this protein complex is stabilized by the fungal phytotoxin fusicoccin A. The knowledge gained from the process in plants was transferred to and applied in human models to find stabilizers or inhibitors of 14-3-3 interaction in human cellular pathways.",a hub protein,No,"14-3-3v is an example of a type of protein called a hub protein, but hub proteins are not complexes"

It also predicted no direct modulation of PI4KB enzymatic activity by 14-3-3 proteins and that 14-3-3 binding will not interfere with PI4KB recruitment to the membrane by the ACBD3 protein. In addition, the structural analysis explains the observed protection from degradation; it revealed that several disordered regions of PI4KB become protected from proteolytical degradation upon 14-3-3 binding. All the structural predictions were subsequently biochemically validated.",PI4KB,Yes,

Thus, the role of G. lamblia 14-3-3 (Gl-14-3-3) in actin regulation was unknown. Gl-14-3-3 depletion resulted in an overall disruption of actin organization characterized by ectopically distributed short actin filaments. Using phosphatase and kinase inhibitors, we demonstrated that actin phosphorylation correlated with destabilization of the actin network and increased complex formation with 14-3-3, while blocking actin phosphorylation stabilized actin filaments and attenuated complex formation. Giardia's sole Rho family GTPase, Gl-Rac, modulates Gl-14-3-3's association with actin, providing the first connection between Gl-Rac and the actin cytoskeleton in Giardia.",phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding protein 14-3-3 is known to regulate actin;,No,"14-3-3 is a protein that regulates actin formation and while actin is made of protein, it is structural and 14-3-3 is not complexing with it"

This viewpoint is built on the “hub” nature of the 14-3-3 proteins, binding to several hundred identified partners, consequently implicating them in a multitude of different cellular mechanisms. In this review, we provide an overview of the structural and biological features of 14-3-3 and the modulation of 14-3-3 PPIs for discovering small molecular inhibitors and stabilizers of 14-3-3 PPIs.",eukaryotic conserved regulatory proteins,No,14-3-3 is an example of a eukaryotic conserved regulatory protein 
Q4-1,seedev_train_399,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,BRI1,Protein_Complex,"The plasma membrane-spanning receptor brassinosteroid insenstive 1 (BRI1) rapidly induces plant cell wall expansion in response to brassinosteroids such as brassinolide (BL). Wall expansion is accompanied by a rapid hyperpolarisation of the plasma membrane which is recordable by measuring the fluorescence lifetime (FLT) of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to BRI1. For the BL induction of hyperpolarisation and wall expansion, the activation of the plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPase is necessary. Furthermore, the activation of the P-ATPase requires BRI1 kinase activity and appears to be mediated by a BL-modulated association of BRI1 with the proton pump. Here, we show that BRI1 also associates with a mutant version of the Arabidopsis P-ATPase 1 (AHA1) characterized by an exchange of a well-known regulatory threonine for a non-phosphorylatable residue in the auto-inhibitory C-terminal domain. Even more important, BRI1 is still able to activate this AHA1 mutant in response to BL. This suggests a novel mechanism for the enzymatic activation of the P-ATPase by BRI1 in the plasma membrane.",green fluorescent protein,No,Green fluorescent protein is fused to BRI1 as part of the experiment but GFP is not a complex

BRI1, a protein localized to the plasma membrane, functions as a BR receptor and it has been proposed that its kinase activity has an essential role in BR-regulated plant growth and development. Here we report the isolation and molecular characterization of a new allele of bri1, bri1-301, which shows moderate morphological phenotypes and a reduced response to BRs under normal growth conditions. Sequence analysis identified a two-base alteration from GG to AT, resulting in a conversion of 989G to 989I in the BRI1 kinase domain. An in vitro assay of kinase activity showed that bri1-301 has no detectable autophosphorylation activity or phosphorylation activity towards the BRI1 substrates TTL and BAK1. Furthermore, our results suggest that bri1-301, even with extremely impaired kinase activity, still retains partial function in regulating plant growth and development, which raises the question of whether BRI1 kinase activity is essential for BR-mediated growth and development in higher plants.",localized to the plasma membrane,No,Incorrect object type.

This suggested that the 2,3-hydroxyl groups of BL play a more significant role in the interaction with a BRI1 partner protein rather than BRI1 itself in rice lamina joint inclination. Taken together it was demonstrated that BL, the most potent agonist of BRI1, is transformed into an antagonist by functionalization of the 2,3-dihydroxyl groups as the acetonide. This finding opens the door to the potential development of a chemical tool that modulates protein-protein interactions in the BR signaling pathway to dissect the BR-dependent processes.",rice lamina joint inclination,No,
Q4-4,seedev_train_399,Composes_Protein_Complex,Protein,BRI1,Protein_Complex,"Seven dwarf mutants resembling brassinosteroid (BR)-biosynthetic dwarfs were isolated that did not respond significantly to the application of exogenous BRs. Genetic and molecular analyses revealed that these were novel alleles of BRI1 (Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1), which encodes a receptor kinase that may act as a receptor for BRs or be involved in downstream signaling. The results of morphological and molecular analyses indicated that these represent a range of alleles from weak to null. The endogenous BRs were examined from 5-week-old plants of a null allele (bri1-4) and two weak alleles (bri1-5 and bri1-6). Previous analysis of endogenous BRs in several BR-biosynthetic dwarf mutants revealed that active BRs are deficient in these mutants. However, bri1-4 plants accumulated very high levels of brassinolide, castasterone, and typhasterol (57-, 128-, and 33-fold higher, respectively, than those of wild-type plants).

In agreement with the finding that BAK1/ELG is involved in the perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), the bak1/elg-D plants exhibited increased Pseudomonas syringae growth. Therefore, bak1/elg-D promotes Arabidopsis growth by stimulating BR signaling at the expense of its readiness to respond to biotic stress factors.

BAK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate on numerous serine/threonine sites in vitro as well as to transphosphorylate associated receptor kinases both in vitro and in planta. In the present study we identify Tyr-610 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of BAK1 as a major site of autophosphorylation that is brassinolide-induced in vivo and requires a kinase-active BAK1. Expression of BAK1(Y610F)-Flag in transgenic plants lacking the endogenous bak1 and its functional paralogue, bkk1, produced plants that were viable but extremely small and generally resembled BR signaling mutants, whereas an acidic substitution for Tyr-610 to mimic phosphorylation restored normal growth. Several lines of evidence support the notion that BR signaling is impaired in the BAK1(Y610F)-Flag plants, and are consistent with the recently proposed sequential transphosphorylation model for BRI1/BAK1 interaction and activation. In contrast, the FLS2-mediated inhibition of seedling growth by the flg22 elicitor occurred normally in the Y610F-directed mutant.",leucine,No,"Leucine is a particular amino acid that composes the BAK1 protein itself, not a new protein or complex."

BAK1 abdominal aorta cDNA from AAA patients and nondiseased individuals were compared with each other, as well as to the BAK1 genomic sequence obtained from matching blood samples. We found specific BAK1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) containing alleles in both aneurysmic (31 cases) and healthy aortic tissue (5 cases) without seeing them in the matching blood samples. These same BAK1 SNPs have been reported, although rarely (average frequency <0.06%), in reference BAK1 DNA sequences.

Activation of the plant immunoreceptor Flagellin sensing2 (FLS2) by its bacterial ligand flagellin or the peptide-epitope flg22 coincides with rapid complex formation with a second receptor kinase termed brassinosteroid receptor1 associated kinase1 (BAK1). Here, we show that the receptor pair of FLS2 and BAK1 is also functional when the roles of the complex partners are reversed by swapping their cytosolic domains. This reciprocal constellation prevents interference by redundant partners that can partially substitute for BAK1 and demonstrates that formation of the heteromeric complex is the molecular switch for transmembrane signaling.
