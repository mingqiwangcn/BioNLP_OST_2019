LEC2 is required for the maintenance of suspensor morphology, specification of cotyledon identity, progression through the maturation phase, and suppression of premature germination. We cloned the LEC2 gene on the basis of its chromosomal position and showed that the predicted polypeptide contains a B3 domain, a DNA-binding motif unique to plants that is characteristic of several transcription factors. We showed that LEC2 RNA accumulates primarily during seed development, consistent with our finding that LEC2 shares greatest similarity with the B3 domain transcription factors that act primarily in developing seeds, VIVIPAROUS1/ABA INSENSITIVE3 and FUSCA3. Ectopic, postembryonic expression of LEC2 in transgenic plants induces the formation of somatic embryos and other organ-like structures and often confers embryonic characteristics to seedlings. Together, these results suggest that LEC2 is a transcriptional regulator that establishes a cellular environment sufficient to initiate embryo development. Embryogenesis in flowering plants begins with the double fertilization event in which the zygote and endosperm are formed after fusion of sperm cells with the egg cell and central cell of the female gametophyte, respectively.",DNA,No,"Incorrect object type.

Q1-3,seedev_dev_321,Binds_To,Protein_Domain,B3 domain,Box,"It is known that the B3 domain of VP1, when taken out of its native context, binds in vitro to the DNA element TCCATGCAT (Suzuki et al. 1997). It is likely, therefore, that the B3 domain of FUS3 similarly mediates binding to specific promoter sequences (Bäumlein et al. 1994). The same applies to ABI3 (Nambara et al. 1995 ;Parcy et al. 1994). During embryogenesis the FUS3 transcript becomes detectable 2 d.a.p. paralleled by the appearance of the ABI3 mRNA. The finding of co-expression at differing levels, however, is consistent with the fact that FUS3 and ABI3, in a combinatorial and synergistic fashion, control overlapping yet not identical aspects of Arabidopsis seed maturation (Parcy et al. 1997). Future studies will have to elucidate to what extent structural similarities of FUS3 and ABI3 contribute to this synergism. So far, FUS3 is the smallest member of the protein family characterized by VP1/ABI3-like B3 domains (Fig. 6).

Q1-4,seedev_dev_321,Binds_To,Protein_Domain,B3 domain,Box,"A novel DNA binding motif, the B3 domain, has been identified in a number of transcription factors specific to higher plant species, and was recently found to define a new protein fold. Here we report the second structure of a B3 domain, that of the Arabidopsis thaliana protein, At1g16640. As part of an effort to 'rescue' structural genomics targets deemed unsuitable for structure determination as full-length proteins, we applied a combined bioinformatic and experimental strategy to identify an optimal construct containing a predicted conserved domain. By screening a series of N- and C-terminally truncated At1g16640 fragments, we isolated a stable folded domain that met our criteria for structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the B3 domain of At1g16640 consists of a seven-stranded beta-sheet arranged in an open barrel and two short alpha-helices, one at each end of the barrel. While At1g16640 is quite distinct from previously characterized B3 domain proteins in terms of amino acid sequence similarity, it adopts the same novel fold that was recently revealed by the RAV1 B3 domain structure. However, putative DNA-binding elements conserved in B3 domains from the RAV, ARF, and ABI3/VP1 subfamilies are largely absent in At1g16640, perhaps suggesting that B3 domains could function in contexts other than transcriptional regulation.",DNA,No,"Incorrect object type.

Q1-5,seedev_dev_321,Binds_To,Protein_Domain,B3 domain,Box,"The B3 DNA-binding domain is a plant-specific domain found throughout the plant kingdom from the alga Chlamydomonas to grasses and flowering plants. Over 100 B3 domain-containing proteins are found in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and one of these is critical for accelerating flowering in response to prolonged cold treatment, an epigenetic process called vernalization. Despite the specific phenotype of genetic vrn1 mutants, the VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) protein localizes throughout the nucleus and shows sequence-nonspecific binding in vitro. In this work, we used a dominant repressor tag that overcomes genetic redundancy to show that VRN1 is involved in processes beyond vernalization that are essential for Arabidopsis development. To understand its sequence-nonspecific binding, we crystallized VRN1(208-341) and solved its crystal structure to 1.6 Å resolution using selenium/single-wavelength anomalous diffraction methods. The crystallized construct comprises the second VRN1 B3 domain and a preceding region conserved among VRN1 orthologs but absent in other B3 domains. We established the DNA-binding face using NMR and then mutated positively charged residues on this surface with a series of 16 Ala and Glu substitutions, ensuring that the protein fold was not disturbed using heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra.",DNA,No,

Importantly, bZIP25, which is expressed specifically in seeds, MYC1, which controls flavonoid biosynthesis, and the R2R3-type gene MYB51, which is involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites, were associated with the eQTL hotspots, and these genes might thus be involved in different flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in rapeseed. Hence, further studies of the functions of these genes will provide insight into the regulatory mechanism underlying flavonoid biosynthesis, and lay the foundation for elaborating the molecular mechanism of seed coat color formation in B. napus.",seeds,No,Incorrect object type; seeds are not a protein. 
Q2-2,seedev_train_760,Binds_To,Protein,bZIP25,Protein,"The binding of the bacteriophage phi X 174-coded A and A* proteins to single-stranded (ssDNA) and double-stranded (dsDNA ) phi X DNA was studied by electron microscopy. The interaction of the A* protein with ssDNA and dsDNA was also studied by sedimentation velocity centrifugation. It was shown that the binding of the A and A* proteins to ssDNA occurs in a non-cooperative manner and requires no or very little sequence specificity under the conditions used here. Both protein-ssDNA complexes have the same compact structure caused by intrastrand cross-linking through the interaction of protein molecules with separate parts of the ssDNA molecule. The A protein does not bind to phi X dsDNA in the absence of divalent cations. The A* protein does bind to dsDNA, although it has a strong preference for binding to ssDNA. The structure of the A* protein-dsDNA complexes is different from that of the A* protein-ssDNA complexes, as the former have a rosette-like structure caused by protein-protein interactions.

Q2-3,seedev_train_760,Binds_To,Protein,bZIP25,Protein,"The immunoglobulin (Ig) G binding properties of protein A made affinity chromatography with protein A an acceptable method for isolation of IgG in mammals. Rabbit IgG was isolated by fractionation of serum on a column containing protein A coupled to Sepharose.

The second peak, after washing with 1M acetic acid eluate (pH 7.0) as shown in the Ouchterlony agar immunodiffusion test, was the IgG fraction. Similar studies on normal and hyperimmune chicken sera indicated that chicken IgG does not bind to protein A molecules.

Q3-1,seedev_dev_266,Binds_To,Protein,bZIP10,Box,"Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) is an essential mitochondrial enzyme involved in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory chain. In Arabidopsis thaliana, its iron-sulfur subunit (SDH2) is encoded by three genes, one of them (SDH2.3) being specifically expressed during seed maturation in the embryo. Here we show that seed SDH2.3 expression is regulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and we define the promoter region (-114 to +49) possessing all the cis-elements necessary and sufficient for high expression in seeds. This region includes between -114 and -32 three ABRE (ABA-responsive) elements and one RY-enhancer like element, and we demonstrate that these elements, although necessary, are not sufficient for seed expression, our results supporting a role for the region encoding the 5' untranslated region (+1 to +49). The SDH2.3 promoter is activated in leaf protoplasts by heterodimers between the basic leucine zipper transcription factors bZIP53 (group S1) and bZIP10 (group C) acting through the ABRE elements, and by the B3 domain transcription factor ABA insensitive 3 (ABI3).",(group C),No,

The same proteins are known to bind to the proximal, but not to the distal, CACCC, box in the human beta-globin promoter.

We show that a B-cell factor binds to a sequence that is clearly distinguishable from binding sites for the previously described X box binding nuclear proteins RF-X, NF-X, NF-Xc, NF-S, hXBP, and AP-1. Mutations in the DRA X box that disrupt the binding of this factor result in a lower level of gene expression, as does the presence of Id (a trans-dominant regulatory protein that negatively regulates helix-loop-helix proteins). Furthermore, this factor is recognized by antibodies directed against the helix-loop-helix protein A1, a mouse homolog of the immunoglobulin enhancer binding proteins E12/E47, and it binds to sequences in other genes that were previously shown to bind these proteins. By these criteria, this factor is BCF-1.",,Yes,Subject not mentioned.
Q3-4,seedev_dev_266,Binds_To,Protein,bZIP10,Box,"Max, a basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-ZIP) protein, plays a central role in the transcriptional regulation of myc oncoprotein-responsive genes. Myc-max heterodimers bind to consensus E-box motifs near or within the promoters of these genes and activate gene expression, whereas heterodimers between max and members of the mad family of bHLH-ZIP proteins promote transcriptional repression. In contrast to all other members of the myc network, max readily homodimerizes and binds to identical E-box sites in vitro. However, the role for max homodimers in transcriptional repression in vivo is unclear. Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) is a bHLH-ZIP protein which does not interact with members of the myc-max-mad family. By replacing the HLH-ZIP domain of max with that from USF, we created a chimeric protein, max(USF), which was indistinguishable from max with respect to its ability to homodimerize and bind DNA. As expected, however, max(USF) was unable to heterodimerize with any of the tested max partner proteins and was incapable of suppressing c-myc target genes.",,Yes,Subject not mentioned.
Q3-5,seedev_dev_266,Binds_To,Protein,bZIP10,Box,"To activate transcription, most nuclear receptor proteins require coactivators that bind to their ligand-binding domains (LBDs). The Drosophila FTZ-Factor1 (FTZ-F1) protein is a conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, but was previously thought to lack an AF2 motif, a motif that is required for ligand and coactivator binding. Here we show that FTZ-F1 does have an AF2 motif and that it is required to bind a coactivator, the homeodomain-containing protein Fushi tarazu (FTZ). We also show that FTZ contains an AF2-interacting nuclear receptor box, the first to be found in a homeodomain protein. Both interaction motifs are shown to be necessary for physical interactions in vitro and for functional interactions in developing embryos. These unexpected findings have important implications for the conserved homologs of the two proteins.",,Yes,Subject not mentioned.
Q4-1,seedev_train_781,Binds_To,Protein,WRI1,Box,"WRINKLED1 (WRI1) is a transcriptional activator that binds to a conserved sequence (designated as AW box) boxes in the promoters of many genes from central metabolism and fatty acid (FA) synthesis, resulting in their transcription. BIOTIN ATTACHMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING (BADC) proteins lack a biotin-attachment domain and are therefore inactive, but in the presence of excess FA, BADC1 and BADC3 are primarily responsible for the observed long-term irreversible inhibition of ACETYL-COA CARBOXYLASE, and consequently FA synthesis. Here, we tested the interaction of WRI1 with BADC genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and found purified WRI1 bound with high affinity to canonical AW boxes from the promoters of all three BADC genes. Consistent with this observation, both expression of BADC1, BADC2, and BADC3 genes and BADC1 protein levels were reduced in wri1-1 relative to the wild type, and elevated upon WRI1 overexpression. The double mutant badc1 badc2 phenocopied wri1-1 with respect to both reduction in root length and elevation of indole-3-acetic acid-Asp levels relative to the wild type.",AW box) boxes,Yes,AW box is most correct.
Q4-2,seedev_train_781,Binds_To,Protein,WRI1,Box,"Plastidic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) regulates the rate of fatty acid synthesis. This enzyme is composed of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), biotin carboxylase (BC), and carboxyltransferase (CT), which consists of α and β subunits. Among these components, CTβ is encoded by the plastidic genome. In Arabidopsis, BC and CTα are each encoded by a single gene, and there are two genes for BCCP, BCCP1 and BCCP2. Promoter analysis revealed that the 5'-UTR containing the AW box is necessary for the expression of these genes in seeds and seedlings. The results indicated that there are other transcription factors besides WRI1 that bind to the AW box and regulate these genes in organs other than seeds. Although the AW boxes at 748 and 532 bp upstream from the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the BC and CTα genes, respectively, were not functional in seeds, the latter was functional in seedlings. In addition, when these AW boxes were moved to approximately 200 bp upstream from the TSS, they became active in seeds but not in seedlings.",AW box,Yes,
Q4-3,seedev_train_781,Binds_To,Protein,WRI1,Box,"WRI1 binds to the AW-box with two core motifs The WRI1 binding sites in the upstream regions of Pl-PKβ1, KAS1, BCCP2, and SUS2 contained the conserved AW-box sequence 5′-[CnTnG](n)7[CG]-3′ (Figure 4f), and mutational analysis of the site 1 AW-box of Pl-PKβ1 indicated that each of the five conserved nucleotides is critical for WRI1 binding (Figure 5c). The DNA-binding activity of Arabidopsis ANT has been characterized previously. Repeated selection of random oligonucleotides that bind with a recombinant ANT fragment corresponding to two AP2 domains results in enrichment of oligonucleotides with a consensus sequence of 5′-gCAC(A/G)N(A/T)TcCC(a/g)ANG(c/t)-3′ (Nole-Wilson and Krizek, 2000).

Q4-4,seedev_train_781,Binds_To,Protein,WRI1,Box,"Finally, EMSA (Figure 8) and yeast one-hybrid experiments (Figure 7a) demonstrate that WRI1 is able to interact with the BCCP2 promoter, strongly suggesting that this gene is a direct target of WRI1 in planta. It is noteworthy that the fine characterization of the changes in mRNA accumulation for BCCP2, PKp-β1 and WRI1 throughout silique development shows that the induction of the regulatory factor precedes the induction of its targets in the Col-0 accession (Figure 3). This slight delay in the detection of mRNAs corresponding to target genes of WRI1 may presumably illustrate biochemical processes occurring in embryo cells, such as translation of the WRI1 peptide, and post-translational regulations (e.g. translocation of WRI1 towards the nucleus or putative recruitment of its interacting partners). Whereas Cernac and Benning (2004) have reported that expression of WRI1 cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-promoter leads to slightly increased seed oil content, neither the Pro35Sdual:WRI1 nor the ProS2:WRI1 transgene used in the present study efficiently stimulates oil accumulation in the corresponding transgenic seeds (Tables 1 and 2).",BCCP2 promoter,Yes,
Q4-5,seedev_train_781,Binds_To,Protein,WRI1,Box,"Acyl lipids are important constituents of the plant cell. Depending on the cell type, requirements in acyl lipids vary greatly, implying a tight regulation of fatty acid and lipid metabolism. The discovery of the WRINKLED1 (WRI1) transcription factors, members of the AP2-EREBP (APETALA2-ethylene-responsive element binding protein) family, has emphasized the importance of transcriptional regulation for adapting the rate of acyl chain production to cell requirements. Here, we describe the identification of another activator of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, the Arabidopsis MYB92 transcription factor. This MYB and all the members of the subgroups S10 and S24 of MYB transcription factors can directly activate the promoter of BCCP2 that encodes a component of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Two adjacent MYB cis-regulatory elements are essential for the binding and activation of the BCCP2 promoter by MYB92. Overexpression of MYB92 or WRI1 in Nicotiana benthamiana induces the expression of fatty acid biosynthetic genes but results in the accumulation of different types of acyl lipids. In the presence of WRI1, triacylglycerol biosynthetic enzymes coded by constitutively expressed genes efficiently channel the excess fatty acids toward reserve lipid accumulation.",AP2-EREBP (APETALA2-ethylene-responsive element,No,Object describes a family of proteins that include WRI1.
Q5-1,seedev_train_378,Binds_To,Protein,CLV3,Protein_Complex,"It is believed that CLAVATA3 (CLV3) encodes a peptide ligand that interacts with the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex to limit the number of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana; however, the exact composition of the functional CLV3 product remains a mystery. A recent study on CLV3 shows that the CLV3/ESR (CLE) motif, together with the adjacent C-terminal sequence, is sufficient to execute CLV3 function when fused behind an N-terminal sequence of ERECTA. Here we show that most of the sequences flanking the CLE motif of CLV3 can be deleted without affecting CLV3 function. Using a liquid culture assay, we demonstrate that CLV3p, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the CLE motif of CLV3, is able to restrict the size of the shoot apical meristem in clv3 seedlings but not in clv1 seedlings. In accordance with this decrease in meristem size, application of CLV3p to in vitro-grown clv3 seedlings restricts the expression of the stem cell-promoting transcription factor WUSCHEL. Thus, we propose that the CLE motif is the functional region of CLV3 and that this region acts independently of its adjacent sequences.",CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex,Yes,

Here, we show biochemical evidence, by ligand binding assay and photoaffinity labeling, that the CLV3 peptide directly binds the CLV1 ectodomain with a dissociation constant of 17.5 nM. The CLV1 ectodomain also interacts with the structurally related CLE peptides, with distinct affinities depending on the specific amino acid sequence.

In shoot and floral meristems of Arabidopsis, the stem cells secret CLV3, a founding member of the CLE protein family, that activates the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex and negatively regulates WUSCHEL expression to restrict the size of the stem cell population. Mis-expression of Hg-SYV46 in Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia-0) under control of the CaMV35S promoter resulted in a wus-like phenotype including premature termination of the shoot apical meristem and the development of flowers lacking the central gynoecium. The wus-like phenotype observed was similar to reports of over-expression of CLV3 and CLE40 in Arabidopsis, as was down-regulation of WUS expression in the shoot apices of 35S::Hg-SYV46/Col-0 plants.",CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex,Yes,
Q5-5,seedev_train_378,Binds_To,Protein,CLV3,Protein_Complex,"In the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem, an organizing center signals in a non-cell-autonomous manner to specify the overlying stem cells. Stem cells express the small, secreted protein CLAVATA3 (CLV3; ) that activates the CLV1-CLV2 receptor complex, which negatively controls the size of the organizing center. Consistently, CLV3 overexpression restricts shoot meristem size. The root meristem also contains a stem cell organizer, and here we show that localized overexpression in roots of CLE19, encoding a CLV3 homolog, restricts the size of the root meristem. This suggests that CLE19 acts by overactivating an endogenous CLV-like pathway involved in root meristem maintenance. Surprisingly, CLE19 restricts meristem size without directly interfering with organizer and stem cell specification. We isolated mutations in two loci, SOL1 and SOL2, which suppress the CLE19 overexpression phenotype. sol2 plants display floral phenotypes reminiscent of clv weak alleles; these phenotypes suggest that components of a CLV pathway are shared in roots and shoots. SOL1 encodes a putative Zn(2+)-carboxypeptidase, which may be involved in ligand processing.","CLV1-CLV2 receptor complex,",Yes,
