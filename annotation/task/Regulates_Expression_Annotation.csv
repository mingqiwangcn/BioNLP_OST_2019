Q1-2,seedev_train_915,Regulates_Expression,Tissue,embryo proper,Gene,Our data also suggest that Oct1 is required in the embryo proper from late gastrulation stages onwards.,Oct1,No,"Proteins regulate gene expression, tissues do not. Subject type should be modified."
Q1-3,seedev_train_915,Regulates_Expression,Tissue,embryo proper,Gene,"The earliest cell fate decision in the mammalian embryo separates the extra-embryonic trophoblast lineage, which forms the fetal portion of the placenta, from the embryonic cell lineages. The body plan of the embryo proper is established only later at gastrulation, when the pluripotent epiblast gives rise to the germ layers ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. Here we show that the T-box gene Eomesodermin performs essential functions in both trophoblast development and gastrulation. Mouse embryos lacking Eomesodermin arrest at the blastocyst stage. Mutant trophoectoderm does not differentiate into trophoblast, indicating that Eomesodermin may be required for the development of trophoblast stem cells. In the embryo proper, Eomesodermin is essential for mesoderm formation. Although the specification of the anterior-posterior axis and the initial response to mesoderm-inducing signals is intact in mutant epiblasts, the prospective mesodermal cells are not recruited into the primitive streak. Our results indicate that Eomesodermin defines a conserved molecular pathway controlling the morphogenetic movements of germ layer formation and has acquired a new function in mammals in the differentiation of trophoblast.",Eomesodermin,No,No regulation of eomesodermin is mentioned.

Q1-5,seedev_train_915,Regulates_Expression,Tissue,embryo proper,Gene,"The application of human embryonic stem (ES) cells in medicine and biology has an inherent reliance on understanding the starting cell population. Human ES cells differ from mouse ES cells and the specific embryonic origin of both cell types is unclear. Previous work suggested that mouse ES cells could only be obtained from the embryo before implantation in the uterus. Here we show that cell lines can be derived from the epiblast, a tissue of the post-implantation embryo that generates the embryo proper. These cells, which we refer to as EpiSCs (post-implantation epiblast-derived stem cells), express transcription factors known to regulate pluripotency, maintain their genomic integrity, and robustly differentiate into the major somatic cell types as well as primordial germ cells. The EpiSC lines are distinct from mouse ES cells in their epigenetic state and the signals controlling their differentiation. Furthermore, EpiSC and human ES cells share patterns of gene expression and signalling responses that normally function in the epiblast. These results show that epiblast cells can be maintained as stable cell lines and interrogated to understand how pluripotent cells generate distinct fates during early development.",pluripotency,No,"Pluripotency is a characteristic of stem cells, not a gene."
Q2-1,seedev_dev_118,Regulates_Expression,Protein,AP2,Gene,"Transcription factor activating protein 2 (AP2) plays an important role in cellular differentiation. Although profound craniofacial and long bone developmental abnormalities have been observed in AP2-knockout mice, the molecular effects of AP2 on osteoblasts are poorly defined. We demonstrated that AP2 regulates the expression of human Frizzled 1 (FZD1), a co-receptor for the Wnt signalling pathway, in human osteoblast cell lines and primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). We also identified a putative AP2-binding site in the FZD1 proximal promoter in silico and characterized this binding element further in Saos2 inÂ vitro by ChIP, electrophoretic mobility shift and promoter reporter assays. The transcriptional repression of the FZD1 promoter by AP2 was confirmed in normal human fetal osteoblasts (hFOB). Furthermore, overexpression of AP2 resulted in a significant reduction in both differentiation and mineralization of Saos2 cells. Knockdown of FZD1 expression before AP2 up-regulation diminished the AP2-dependent inhibition of Saos2 cell differentiation and mineralization. Similarly, overexpressing FZD1 before AP2 treatment in both Saos2 and BMSCs diminished the inhibitory effect of AP2 on osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.","human Frizzled 1 (FZD1),",Yes,
Q2-2,seedev_dev_118,Regulates_Expression,Protein,AP2,Gene,"More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers. The AP2 family also acts as a tumor suppressor. Here we found that p73 and AP2 are able to activate NEU4, a neuraminidase gene, which removes the terminal sialic acid residues from cancer-associated glycans. Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53. The homologous residues in p63 and p73 are L423 and L377, respectively.",NEU4,Yes,
Q2-3,seedev_dev_118,Regulates_Expression,Protein,AP2,Gene,"To verify the role of AP2 alpha, we specifically knocked down AP2 alpha expression with siRNA. A significant AP2 alpha knock-down inhibited PMA-induced MUC8 gene expression. While dominant negative AP2 alpha decreased PMA-induced MUC8 gene expression, overexpressing wildtype AP2 alpha increased MUC8 gene expression. Furthermore, using lentiviral vectors for RNA interference in human nasal polyp epithelial cells, we confirmed an essential role for AP2 alpha in MUC8 gene expression. From these results, we concluded that PMA induces MUC8 gene expression through a mechanism involving PKC, ERK1/2, and AP2 alpha activation in human airway epithelial cells.",PMA-induced MUC8 gene expression.,Yes,
Q2-4,seedev_dev_118,Regulates_Expression,Protein,AP2,Gene,"The adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein aP2 regulates systemic glucose and lipid metabolism. We report that aP2, in addition to being abundantly expressed by adipocytes, is also expressed by human airway epithelial cells and shows a striking upregulation following stimulation of epithelial cells with the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Regulation of aP2 mRNA expression by Th2 cytokines was highly dependent on STAT6, a transcription factor with a major regulatory role in allergic inflammation. We examined aP2-deficient mice in a model of allergic airway inflammation and found that infiltration of leukocytes, especially eosinophils, into the airways was highly dependent on aP2 function. T cell priming was unaffected by aP2 deficiency, suggesting that aP2 was acting locally within the lung, and analysis of bone marrow chimeras implicated non-hematopoietic cells, most likely bronchial epithelial cells, as the site of action of aP2 in allergic airway inflammation. Thus, aP2 regulates allergic airway inflammation and may provide a link between fatty acid metabolism and asthma.",systemic glucose and lipid metabolism,No,"These are not genes, but features of pathologies."
Q2-5,seedev_dev_118,Regulates_Expression,Protein,AP2,Gene,"The APETALA2 (AP2) genes represent the AP2 group within a large group of DNA-binding proteins called AP2/EREBP. The AP2 gene is functional and necessary for flower development, stem cell maintenance, and seed development, whereas the other members of AP2 group redundantly affect flowering time. Here we study the phylogeny of AP2 group genes in spermatophytes. Spermatophyte AP2 group genes can be classified into AP2 and TOE types, six clades, and we found that the AP2 group homologs in gymnosperms belong to the AP2 type, whereas TOE types are absent, which indicates the AP2 type gene are more ancient and TOE type was split out of AP2 type and losing the major function. In Brassicaceae, the expansion of AP2 and TOE type lead to the gene number of AP2 group were up to six. Purifying selection appears to have been the primary driving force of spermatophyte AP2 group evolution, although positive selection occurred in the AP2 clade. The transition from exon to intron of AtAP2 in Arabidopsis mutant leads to the loss of gene function and the same situation was found in AtTOE2.",flowering time,No,Flowering time is not a gene.
Q3-1,seedev_train_82,Regulates_Expression,Development_Phase,reproductive phase,Promoter,"Plants progress from a juvenile vegetative phase of development to an adult vegetative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated vegetative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the MIR156A promoter. Mutations in BRM not only increased occupancy of the -2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the MIR156A locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of brm mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in SWINGER (SWN), but not by a mutation in CURLEY LEAF, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants.",miR156,No,"The object is correct but the subject is not. BRM (a protein) is what actually regulates miR156. Also, a development phase does not regulate expression, although expression can be restricted to a development phase. "
Q3-2,seedev_train_82,Regulates_Expression,Development_Phase,reproductive phase,Promoter,"Plants undergo a series of developmental transitions during their life cycle. After seed germination, plants pass through two distinct phases: the vegetative phase in which leaves are produced and the reproductive phase in which flowering occurs. Based on the reproductive competence and morphological changes, the vegetative phase can be further divided into juvenile and adult phases. Here, we demonstrate that the difference between juvenile and adult phase of Nicotiana tabacum is characterized by the changes in leaf size, leaf shape as well as the number of leaf epidermal hairs (trichomes). We further show that miR156, an age-regulated microRNA, regulates juvenile-to-adult phase transition in N. tabacum. Overexpression of miR156 results in delayed juvenile-to-adult transition and flowering. Together, our results support an evolutionarily conserved role of miR156 in plant developmental transitions.",flowering,No,"Flowering is a phase, not a promoter. "

Q3-5,seedev_train_82,Regulates_Expression,Development_Phase,reproductive phase,Promoter,"Postembryonic shoot development in maize (Zea mays L.) is divided into a juvenile vegetative phase, an adult vegetative phase, and a reproductive phase that differ in the expression of many morphological traits. A reduction in the endogenous levels of bioactive gibberellins (GAs) conditioned by any one of the dwarf1, dwarf3, dwarf5, or anther ear1 mutations in maize delays the transition from juvenile vegetative to adult vegetative development and from adult vegetative to reproductive development. Mutant plants cease producing juvenile traits (e.g. epicuticular wax) and begin producing adult traits (e.g. epidermal hairs) later than wild-type plants. They also cease producing leaves and begin producing reproductive structures later than wild-type plants. These mutations greatly enhance most aspects of the phenotype of Teopod1 and Teopod2, suggesting that GAs suppress part but not all of the Teopod phenotype. Application of GA<inf>3</inf> to Teopod2 mutants and Teopod1, dwarf3 double mutants confirms this result. We conclude that GAs act in conjunction with several other factors to promote both vegetative and reproductive maturation but affect different developmental phases unequally.",reproductive phase that differ in the expression of many morphological traits,No,
Q4-1,seedev_train_668,Regulates_Expression,Environmental_Factor,ethylene treatment,Gene,"The plant hormone ethylene plays a major role in the ripening of climacteric fruit. We have generated transgenic cantaloupe Charentais melons expressing an antisense ACC oxidase gene; ACC oxidase catalyzes the last step of ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene production of transgenic fruit was < 1% of control untransformed fruit, and the ripening process was blocked both on and off the vine. The antisense phenotype could be reversed by exogenous ethylene treatment. Analysis of antisense ACC oxidase melons indicated that the ripening process includes ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent pathways. Because the transgenic line we generated displays extended storage life and improved quality, it has a promising potential for commercial development.",ACC oxidase gene,Yes,
Q4-2,seedev_train_668,Regulates_Expression,Environmental_Factor,ethylene treatment,Gene,"The ethylene biosynthesis pathway controls flower senescence. Previous studies have shown that Arabidopsis ETHYLENE-OVERPRODUCER1 (ETO1) interacts specifically with and negatively regulates type 2 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases (ACSs), the rate-limiting enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis. The ethylene biosynthesis pathway controls flower senescence in petunias (Petunia hybrida Juss.). However, the role of ETO1-like genes (EOLs) during flower senescence has not been investigated. Here, two full-length petunia EOL cDNAs, PhEOL1 and PhEOL2, were isolated. RT-PCR assays indicated that the expression of PhEOL1 and PhEOL2 increased after exogenous ethylene treatment. The VIGS-mediated silencing of PhEOL1 accelerated flower senescence and produced more ethylene than the control condition, whereas the silencing of PhEOL2 did not. Notably, the effects caused by PhEOL1 suppression were not enhanced by PhEOL2 suppression in corollas. In addition, the expression of two petunia type 2 PhACS genes increased during flower senescence and after ethylene treatment.",flower senescence,No,Best answer her includes PhEOL1 and PhEOL2.
Q4-3,seedev_train_668,Regulates_Expression,Environmental_Factor,ethylene treatment,Gene,"Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (Malus domestica), fruit coloration is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit coloration as well as the expression of MdMYB1, a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of MdMYB1 and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and fruit coloration in apple.",climacteric fruit ripening,No,"Climacteric fruit ripening is a phase, not a gene."

This enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of sucrose and UDP to UDP-glucose and fructose. In the Arabidopsis SUS gene family (six members), SUS2 is strongly and specifically expressed in Arabidopsis seeds during the maturation phase. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that SUS2 is localized in the embryo, endosperm and seed coat with differential patterns. During the maturation phase, the SUS2 protein seems to be mainly co-localized with plastids in the embryo.

Q5-3,seedev_dev_354,Regulates_Expression,Development_Phase,onset of the maturation phase,Gene_Family,"In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In Drosophila melanogaster embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase-promoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7). Our work shows that Rif1 and S phase kinases compose a replication timer controlling first the developmental onset of late replication and then the precise schedule of replication within S phase. In addition, we describe how onset of late replication fits into the progressive maturation of heterochromatin during development.",heterochromatin,No,Heterochromatin is not something that can be expressed; it is DNA that is tightly packed so that is does not get expressed. 
Q5-4,seedev_dev_354,Regulates_Expression,Development_Phase,onset of the maturation phase,Gene_Family,"As a Brassicaceae, Arabidopsis thaliana constitutes an excellent model system to investigate oil biosynthesis in seeds. Extensive tools for the genetic and molecular dissection of this model species are now available. Together with analytical procedures adapted to its tiny seeds, these tools have allowed major advances in isolating and characterising the factors that participate in the metabolic and developmental control of seed filling. Once the biochemical pathways producing storage lipids, namely triacylglycerols, were elucidated, the question of the regulation of this metabolic network has arisen. The coordinated up regulation of genes encoding enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway observed at the onset of seed maturation suggests that the pathway may be subjected to a system of global transcriptional regulation. This has been further established by the study of master regulators of the maturation program like LEAFY COTYLEDON2 and the characterisation of the WRINKLED1 transcription factor. These factors have been shown to participate in a regulatory cascade controlling the induction of the genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis at the onset of the maturation phase. Although much remains to be elucidated, the framework of the regulatory system controlling fatty acid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis seeds is coming into focus.",fatty acid biosynthesis,Yes,
