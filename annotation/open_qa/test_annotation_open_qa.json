Actinobacteria were assayed for their antifungal activity against 16 clinical Candida albicans and the compound analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS. The 31 actinobacterial strains were isolated and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that this ecosystem is rich on actinobacteria, with Streptomyces as the predominant genus. The PCR based screening of biosynthetic genes revealed the presence of PKS-I in six strains, PKS-II in four strains and NRPS in 11 strains. The isolated actinobacteria VITGAP240 and VITGAP241 (two isolates) were found to have a potential antifungal activity against all the tested C. albicans. GC-MS results revealed that the actinobacterial compounds were belonging to heterocyclic, polyketides and peptides.", "Actinobacteria are known for their metabolic potential of producing diverse secondary metabolites such as antibiotics. Actinobacteria also playimportant roles in biogeochemical cycling and how soils develop. However, little is known about the effect of the vegetation type on the actinobacterial community structures in soils from arid regions. For these reasons, we have analyzed the actinobacterial communities of five types of ecosystem (tree grove, shrub, meadow, desert, and farm) in the Heihe river basin. Using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, we found 11 classes of Actinobacteria, with dominant classes of Actinobacteria (36.2%), Thermoleophilia (28.3%), Acidimicrobiia (19.4%). Five classes, 15 orders, 20 families and 36 genera were present in all samples. The dominant generalist genera were Gaiella, Solirubrobacter, Nocardioides, Mycobacterium, and Pseudonocardia. The actinobacterial community structures were significantly affected by the environment and vegetation type. The diversity of the actinobacterial community in the desert ecosystem was high, and this ecosystem harbored the highest proportion of unclassified sequences, representing rare Actinobacteria. Functional metagenomic prediction, using PICRUSt, indicated that Actinobacteria play an important role in nitrogen cycling in both desert and cultivated farm ecosystems.", "Actinobacteria are important producers of bioactive compounds. Extreme ecosystems cause evolution of novel secondary metabolic pathways of Actinobacteria and increase the possible discovery of new biological functions of bioactive compounds. Here, we isolated 65 Actinobacteria from rhizosphere soil samples of Opuntia stricta. An Actinobacteria strain (named SCA3-4) was screened against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4, ATCC 76255). The strain produced pink-white aerial mycelia and brown substrate mycelium on Gause No. 1 agar. Biverticillate chains of cylindrical spores were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on alignment of 16S rRNA sequences, a constructed phylogenetic tree showed that strain SCA3-4 shared a 99.54% similarity with Streptomyces lilacinus NRRL B-1968T. The morphological, biochemical, physiological, and molecular characteristics further indicated that strain SCA3-4 belongs to the Streptomyces sp. It can grow well on medium with the following antibiotics chloramphenicol, streptomycin, penicillin-G, gentamicin, erythromycin, nystatin or neomycin sulfate.", "Actinobacteria are a large group of Gram-positive bacteria common in the environment, especially in the soil.

The E. coli O157:H7 survival dynamics were investigated in 12 representative soils from Jiangsu Province, where the largest E. coli O157:H7 infection in China occurred. It was observed that E. coli O157:H7 declined rapidly in acidic soils (pH, 4.57 - 5.14) but slowly in neutral soils (pH, 6.51 - 7.39).

In addition, sediment nutrients and texture also played significant roles in the survival of E.\u00a0coli O157:H7 in the sediments. On the other hand, bacterial diversity as determined by the alpha-diversity index had no significant effect on E.\u00a0coli O157:H7 survival. However, specific families of bacteria were closely associated with E.\u00a0coli O157:H7 survival in the sediments. Remarkably, some potential bacterial groups, e.g., the Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfarculaceae families, which are mainly involved in the sulfur cycle, showed significant negative correlation with the E.\u00a0coli O157:H7 survival in the sediments.", "Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 is a recently recognized human pathogen associated with hemorrhagic colitis.

Expression profiles of cell lines with E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter methylation were significantly different from those with CDH1 expression or, surprisingly, those with CDH1 truncating mutations. Furthermore, we found no significant differentially expressed genes between cell lines with wild-type and mutated CDH1. The expression profile complied with the fibroblastic morphology of the cell lines with promoter methylation, suggestive of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). All other lines, also the cases with CDH1 mutations, had epithelial features.

What makes cancer spread in the body and invade other organs causing death to the patient? In this paper, we hypothesize that the cellular hyperexcitability via stimulation of mineral channels (e.g. sodium voltage-gated channels) and ligand excitatory receptors (e.g. glutamate and other neuron and non-neuronal excitatory receptors) could be a significant causative and pathogenic factor of cancer.

As part of an effort to 'rescue' structural genomics targets deemed unsuitable for structure determination as full-length proteins, we applied a combined bioinformatic and experimental strategy to identify an optimal construct containing a predicted conserved domain. By screening a series of N- and C-terminally truncated At1g16640 fragments, we isolated a stable folded domain that met our criteria for structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the B3 domain of At1g16640 consists of a seven-stranded beta-sheet arranged in an open barrel and two short alpha-helices, one at each end of the barrel. While At1g16640 is quite distinct from previously characterized B3 domain proteins in terms of amino acid sequence similarity, it adopts the same novel fold that was recently revealed by the RAV1 B3 domain structure.

Among these components, CT\u03b2 is encoded by the plastidic genome. In Arabidopsis, BC and CT\u03b1 are each encoded by a single gene, and there are two genes for BCCP, BCCP1 and BCCP2. Promoter analysis revealed that the 5'-UTR containing the AW box is necessary for the expression of these genes in seeds and seedlings. The results indicated that there are other transcription factors besides WRI1 that bind to the AW box and regulate these genes in organs other than seeds. Although the AW boxes at 748 and 532 bp upstream from the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the BC and CT\u03b1 genes, respectively, were not functional in seeds, the latter was functional in seedlings.

It is noteworthy that the fine characterization of the changes in mRNA accumulation for BCCP2, PKp-\u03b21 and WRI1 throughout silique development shows that the induction of the regulatory factor precedes the induction of its targets in the Col-0 accession (Figure\u00a03). This slight delay in the detection of mRNAs corresponding to target genes of WRI1 may presumably illustrate biochemical processes occurring in embryo cells, such as translation of the WRI1 peptide, and post-translational regulations (e.g. translocation of WRI1 towards the nucleus or putative recruitment of its interacting partners). Whereas Cernac and Benning (2004) have reported that expression of WRI1 cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-promoter leads to slightly increased seed oil content, neither the Pro35Sdual:WRI1 nor the ProS2:WRI1 transgene used in the present study efficiently stimulates oil accumulation in the corresponding transgenic seeds (Tables\u00a01 and 2).", "Acyl lipids are important constituents of the plant cell.

A recent study on CLV3 shows that the CLV3/ESR (CLE) motif, together with the adjacent C-terminal sequence, is sufficient to execute CLV3 function when fused behind an N-terminal sequence of ERECTA. Here we show that most of the sequences flanking the CLE motif of CLV3 can be deleted without affecting CLV3 function. Using a liquid culture assay, we demonstrate that CLV3p, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the CLE motif of CLV3, is able to restrict the size of the shoot apical meristem in clv3 seedlings but not in clv1 seedlings. In accordance with this decrease in meristem size, application of CLV3p to in vitro-grown clv3 seedlings restricts the expression of the stem cell-promoting transcription factor WUSCHEL. Thus, we propose that the CLE motif is the functional region of CLV3 and that this region acts independently of its adjacent sequences.", "CLV1, which encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, and CLV3, which encodes a secreted peptide, function in the same genetic pathway to maintain stem cell populations in Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem. Here, we show biochemical evidence, by ligand binding assay and photoaffinity labeling, that the CLV3 peptide directly binds the CLV1 ectodomain with a dissociation constant of 17.5 nM. The CLV1 ectodomain also interacts with the structurally related CLE peptides, with distinct affinities depending on the specific amino acid sequence.

Here, using nano-LC-MS/MS analysis of apoplastic peptides of A. thaliana plants overexpressing CLV3, we show that CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide. Post-translational arabinosylation of CLV3 is critical for its biological activity and high-affinity binding to its receptor CLV1.", "SUMMARY The Hg-SYV46 parasitism gene is expressed exclusively in the dorsal oesophageal gland cell of parasitic stages of the soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines, and it encodes a secretory protein that contains a C-terminal motif of the CLAVATA3/ESR-related (CLE) family in Arabidopsis thaliana. In shoot and floral meristems of Arabidopsis, the stem cells secret CLV3, a founding member of the CLE protein family, that activates the CLV1/CLV2 receptor complex and negatively regulates WUSCHEL expression to restrict the size of the stem cell population. Mis-expression of Hg-SYV46 in Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia-0) under control of the CaMV35S promoter resulted in a wus-like phenotype including premature termination of the shoot apical meristem and the development of flowers lacking the central gynoecium. The wus-like phenotype observed was similar to reports of over-expression of CLV3 and CLE40 in Arabidopsis, as was down-regulation of WUS expression in the shoot apices of 35S::Hg-SYV46/Col-0 plants.", "In the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem, an organizing center signals in a non-cell-autonomous manner to specify the overlying stem cells. Stem cells express the small, secreted protein CLAVATA3 (CLV3; ) that activates the CLV1-CLV2 receptor complex, which negatively controls the size of the organizing center. Consistently, CLV3 overexpression restricts shoot meristem size. The root meristem also contains a stem cell organizer, and here we show that localized overexpression in roots of CLE19, encoding a CLV3 homolog, restricts the size of the root meristem. This suggests that CLE19 acts by overactivating an endogenous CLV-like pathway involved in root meristem maintenance. Surprisingly, CLE19 restricts meristem size without directly interfering with organizer and stem cell specification. We isolated mutations in two loci, SOL1 and SOL2, which suppress the CLE19 overexpression phenotype. sol2 plants display floral phenotypes reminiscent of clv weak alleles; these phenotypes suggest that components of a CLV pathway are shared in roots and shoots.

We have shown previously that the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) gene in Arabidopsis encodes a receptor kinase-like protein that controls the size of the apical and floral meristems. Here, we show that KAPP, a gene encoding a kinase-associated protein phosphatase, is expressed in apical and young floral meristems, along with CLV1. Overexpression of KAPP mimics the clv1 mutant phenotype. Furthermore, CLV1 has kinase activity: it phosphorylates both itself and KAPP. Finally, KAPP binds and dephosphorylates CLV1.

The diterpene increased the maximal responses and lowered the EC50 for both isoproterenol- and prostaglandin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. Forskolin did not modify the Ki for the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. Activation of cyclic AMP generation by forskolin was biphasic with respect to concentration; the major response being mediated by a low affinity interaction (Kapp 28 microM) and a minor effect being due to an interaction with a high affinity site (Kapp 0.5 microM). By contrast, the synergistic effect of the diterpene with isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2 as well as with cholera toxin, involved a single component of high affinity (Kapp 0.5 to 2 microM), which was thus considered to be associated with the activated complex of the cyclase catalytic subunit and the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.

The interaction between the KAPP-CFP/YFP and AtSERK1-CFP/YFP fusion proteins was investigated with fluorescence spectral imaging microscopy (FSPIM). Our results show that AtSERK1-CFP and KAPP-YFP proteins are colocalized at the plasma membrane but only show fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) indicative of physical interaction in intracellular vesicles.

We report the functional characterization in rice of a constitutive floral inhibitor, OsCOL16, encoding a group-II CO-like protein that delays flowering time and increases plant height and grain yield. Overexpression of OsCOL16 resulted in late heading under both long-day and short-day conditions. OsCOL16 expression exhibits a diurnal oscillation and serves as a transcription factor with transcriptional activation activity. We determined that OsCOL16 up-regulates the expression of the floral repressor Ghd7, leading to down-regulation of the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1. Moreover, genetic diversity and evolutionary analyses suggest that remarkable differences in flowering times correlate with two major alleles of OsCOL16.

The design of this peptide was based on part of the primary structure of an LEA protein that is known hydrophilic protein to suppress aggregation of other protein molecules. In our system, the expression of the target protein was increased remarkably by co-expression with an LEA-like peptide consisting of only 11 amino acid residues.

It is likely that they represent receptor maintenance or trafficking functions. Previously, it was shown that SERK1 could interact with 14-3-3\u03bb (Rienties et al., 2005). The results presented here suggest that the receptor preferentially interacts with 14-3-3\u03bd in seedlings and perhaps with 14-3-3\u03bb in siliques, given the origin of the Arabidopsis cDNA library from young silique tissue that was used for yeast two-hybrid screening.

For the BL induction of hyperpolarisation and wall expansion, the activation of the plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPase is necessary. Furthermore, the activation of the P-ATPase requires BRI1 kinase activity and appears to be mediated by a BL-modulated association of BRI1 with the proton pump. Here, we show that BRI1 also associates with a mutant version of the Arabidopsis P-ATPase 1 (AHA1) characterized by an exchange of a well-known regulatory threonine for a non-phosphorylatable residue in the auto-inhibitory C-terminal domain. Even more important, BRI1 is still able to activate this AHA1 mutant in response to BL.

Sequence analysis identified a two-base alteration from GG to AT, resulting in a conversion of 989G to 989I in the BRI1 kinase domain. An in vitro assay of kinase activity showed that bri1-301 has no detectable autophosphorylation activity or phosphorylation activity towards the BRI1 substrates TTL and BAK1.

The results of morphological and molecular analyses indicated that these represent a range of alleles from weak to null. The endogenous BRs were examined from 5-week-old plants of a null allele (bri1-4) and two weak alleles (bri1-5 and bri1-6).

Expression of BAK1(Y610F)-Flag in transgenic plants lacking the endogenous bak1 and its functional paralogue, bkk1, produced plants that were viable but extremely small and generally resembled BR signaling mutants, whereas an acidic substitution for Tyr-610 to mimic phosphorylation restored normal growth.

We also identified a putative AP2-binding site in the FZD1 proximal promoter in silico and characterized this binding element further in Saos2 in\u00a0vitro by ChIP, electrophoretic mobility shift and promoter reporter assays. The transcriptional repression of the FZD1 promoter by AP2 was confirmed in normal human fetal osteoblasts (hFOB). Furthermore, overexpression of AP2 resulted in a significant reduction in both differentiation and mineralization of Saos2 cells. Knockdown of FZD1 expression before AP2 up-regulation diminished the AP2-dependent inhibition of Saos2 cell differentiation and mineralization. Similarly, overexpressing FZD1 before AP2 treatment in both Saos2 and BMSCs diminished the inhibitory effect of AP2 on osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.", "More than 50% of colon cancers bear mutations in p53, one of the most important tumor suppressors, and its family members p63 or p73 are expected to contribute to inhibiting the progression of colon cancers.

Under serum starvation, NEU4 was up-regulated and one of the NEU4 target glycans, sialyl Lewis X, was decreased, whereas p73 and AP2 were up-regulated. Sialyl Lewis X levels were not, however, decreased under starvation conditions in p73- or AP2-knockdown cells. p53 and AP2 underwent protein-protein interactions, exerting synergistic effects to activate p21, and interaction of p53 with AP2 was lost in cells expressing the L350P mutation of p53.

While dominant negative AP2 alpha decreased PMA-induced MUC8 gene expression, overexpressing wildtype AP2 alpha increased MUC8 gene expression. Furthermore, using lentiviral vectors for RNA interference in human nasal polyp epithelial cells, we confirmed an essential role for AP2 alpha in MUC8 gene expression.

Regulation of aP2 mRNA expression by Th2 cytokines was highly dependent on STAT6, a transcription factor with a major regulatory role in allergic inflammation. We examined aP2-deficient mice in a model of allergic airway inflammation and found that infiltration of leukocytes, especially eosinophils, into the airways was highly dependent on aP2 function. T cell priming was unaffected by aP2 deficiency, suggesting that aP2 was acting locally within the lung, and analysis of bone marrow chimeras implicated non-hematopoietic cells, most likely bronchial epithelial cells, as the site of action of aP2 in allergic airway inflammation.

Here, we demonstrate that the difference between juvenile and adult phase of Nicotiana tabacum is characterized by the changes in leaf size, leaf shape as well as the number of leaf epidermal hairs (trichomes). We further show that miR156, an age-regulated microRNA, regulates juvenile-to-adult phase transition in N. tabacum.

In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of MdMYB1 and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit coloration. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation.

In Drosophila melanogaster embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase-promoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7).

Once the biochemical pathways producing storage lipids, namely triacylglycerols, were elucidated, the question of the regulation of this metabolic network has arisen. The coordinated up regulation of genes encoding enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway observed at the onset of seed maturation suggests that the pathway may be subjected to a system of global transcriptional regulation. This has been further established by the study of master regulators of the maturation program like LEAFY COTYLEDON2 and the characterisation of the WRINKLED1 transcription factor.

Public microarray data suggest that the expression of SOM mRNA is regulated also by ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), another key regulator of seed germination. By analyzing abi3 mutants and ABI3 overexpression lines, we show here that ABI3 activates the expression of SOM mRNA collaboratively with PIL5 in imbibed seeds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis coupled with electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicate that ABI3 activates the expression of SOM mRNA by directly binding to two RY motifs present in the SOM promoter in vivo, which is further supported by the greatly decreased expression of a reporter gene driven by a SOM promoter bearing mutated RY motifs.

Aberrantly spliced transcripts were present in different cell types including liver, the main expressing tissue for both protein C and protein S. In an attempt to compare individual mRNA splicing patterns, PROC and PROS RNA from easily accessible cells of different healthy control individuals was studied. However, variation between different RT-PCR assays from the same individual precluded both the relative quantitation of the aberrant transcripts and the analysis of interindividual differences.

Marked differences are observed in the size of the mos RNA transcripts detected in different tissues. All transcripts appear to end at the same 3' position, and the tissue-specific size variations appear to be due to the use of different promoters. For example, the testicular and ovarian RNA transcripts initiate approximately 280 and approximately 70 base pairs, respectively, upstream from the first initiation codon, but both end at a common site downstream from the mos open reading frame. The expression of mos is developmentally regulated in gonadal tissue. Thus, the level of mos transcripts in testes is low for the first 3 weeks after birth, increases at least 10-fold around day 25, and reaches adult levels by day 30. In contrast, ovaries from preweaning mice contain a higher level of mos mRNA compared to ovaries from adult mice. In cell fractionation experiments we show that mos transcripts are present in haploid germ cells.

Twenty-six genes with primary expression in the nervous system were selected as targets based on an expression screen previously conducted in X. laevis. Reproducible phenotypes were observed for six and for four of these, a second MO gave a similar result. One of these genes encodes a novel protein with previously unknown function.

For example, the bacterial pathogen strain Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PtoDC3000) produces the plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) to promote PtoDC3000 growth in plant tissue. Previous studies suggest that auxin may promote PtoDC3000 pathogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including both suppression of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated host defenses and via an unknown mechanism that appears to be independent of SA. To test if host auxin signaling is important during pathogenesis, we took advantage of Arabidopsis thaliana lines impaired in either auxin signaling or perception. We found that disruption of auxin signaling in plants expressing an inducible dominant axr2-1 mutation resulted in decreased bacterial growth and that this phenotype was suppressed by introducing the sid2-2 mutation, which impairs SA synthesis. Thus, host auxin signaling is required for normal susceptibility to PtoDC3000 and is involved in suppressing SA-mediated defenses.

The auxin responsive protoplasts show an authentic hormonal response identical to that observed in intact pea tissue, with respect to rapidity, specificity and cycloheximide (CHX) inducibility of the PS-IAA4/5 transcript. The hormone also mediates rapid and specific induction of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in protoplasts transfected with a chimeric IAA4/5-CAT gene. The IAA-induced CAT activity is developmentally regulated and is observed only in protoplasts derived from auxin-responsive regions of the pea seedling. Extensive deletion analysis of the PS-IAA4/5 promoter defined a promoter region between -318 and -154 that confers auxin inducibility. This AuxRE mediates auxin-inducible CAT activity in pea cells driven by the non auxin-responsive CaMV 35S minimal promoter.", "The vegetative hormone Auxin is involved in vascular tissues formation throughout the plant. Trans-membrane carrier proteins transporting auxin from cell to cell and distributed asymmetrically around each cell give to auxin a polarized movement in tissues, creating streams of auxin that presume future vascular bundles. According to the canalization hypothesis, auxin transport ability of cells is thought to increase with auxin flux, resulting in the self-enhancement of this flux along auxin paths. In this study we evaluate a series of models based on canalization hypothesis using carrier proteins, under different assumptions concerning auxin flux formation and carrier protein dynamics. Simulations are run on a hexagonal lattice with uniform auxin production. A single cell located in the margin of the lattice indicates the petiole, and acts as an auxin sink. The main results are: (1) We obtain branching auxin distribution patterns. (2) The type of self-enhancement described by the functional form of the carrier proteins regulation responding to the auxin flux intensity in different parts of a cell, has a strong effect on the possibility of generating the branching patterns. For response functions with acceleration in the increase of carrier protein numbers compared to the auxin flux, branching patterns are likely to be generated. For linear or decelerating response functions, no branching patterns are formed.", "The plant hormone auxin plays crucial roles in regulating plant growth development, including embryo and root patterning, organ formation, vascular tissue differentiation and growth responses to environmental stimuli. Asymmetric auxin distribution patterns have been observed within tissues, and these so-called auxin gradients change dynamically during different developmental processes. Most auxin is synthesized in the shoot and distributed directionally throughout the plant. This polar auxin transport is mediated by auxin influx and efflux facilitators, whose subcellular polar localizations guide the direction of auxin flow. The polar localization of PIN auxin efflux carriers changes in response to developmental and external cues in order to channel auxin flow in a regulated manner for organized growth. Auxin itself modulates the expression and subcellular localization of PIN proteins, contributing to a complex pattern of feedback regulation. Here we review the available information mainly from studies of a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, on the generation of auxin gradients, the regulation of polar auxin transport and further downstream cellular events.", "Positional information is essential for coordinating the development of multicellular organisms. In plants, positional information provided by the hormone auxin regulates rhythmic organ production at the shoot apex, but the spatio-temporal dynamics of auxin gradients is unknown. We used quantitative imaging to demonstrate that auxin carries high-definition graded information not only in space but also in time. We show that, during organogenesis, temporal patterns of auxin arise from rhythmic centrifugal waves of high auxin travelling through the tissue faster than growth. We further demonstrate that temporal integration of auxin concentration is required to trigger the auxin-dependent transcription associated with organogenesis.

We calculated this flux from data on root growth velocity, area, and biomass density, taking into account construction and maintenance respiration and the production of mucilage by the root cap.

Analysis of a publicly available data set of outer seed mucilage traits of over 300 accessions showed little natural variation in composition. This mucilage is almost exclusively made up of rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI), highlighting the importance of this pectin for outer mucilage function. In a genome-wide association study, observed variations in polymer amount and macromolecular characteristics were linked to several genome polymorphisms, indicating the complexity of their genetic regulation. Natural variants with high molar mass were associated with a gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase called MUCILAGE-RELATED70 (MUCI70). muci70 insertion mutants produced many short RGI polymers that were highly substituted with xylan, confirming that polymorphism in this gene can affect RGI polymer size.

SCE cells produce mucilage, a specialized secondary wall that is rich in pectin, at a precise stage of development. A coexpression search for MUCILAGE-RELATED (MUCI) genes identified MUCI10 as a key determinant of mucilage properties. MUCI10 is closely related to a fenugreek (Trigonella foenumgraecum) enzyme that has in vitro galactomannan \u03b1-1,6-galactosyltransferase activity. Our detailed analysis of the muci10 mutants demonstrates that mucilage contains highly branched galactoglucomannan (GGM) rather than unbranched glucomannan. MUCI10 likely decorates glucomannan, synthesized by CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE A2, with galactose residues in vivo. The degree of galactosylation is essential for the synthesis of the GGM backbone, the structure of cellulose, mucilage density, as well as the adherence of pectin.", "Arabidopsis seeds rapidly release hydrophilic polysaccharides from the seed coat on imbibition. These form a heavy mucilage layer around the seed that makes it sink in water. Fourteen natural Arabidopsis variants from central Asia and Scandinavia were identified with seeds that have modified mucilage release and float. Four of these have a novel mucilage phenotype with almost none of the released mucilage adhering to the seed and the absence of cellulose microfibrils. Mucilage release was modified in the variants by ten independent causal mutations in four different loci. Seven distinct mutations affected one locus, coding the MUM2 \u03b2-D-galactosidase, and represent a striking example of allelic heterogeneity. The modification of mucilage release has thus evolved a number of times independently in two restricted geographical zones. All the natural mutants identified still accumulated mucilage polysaccharides in seed coat epidermal cells. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry their production and retention was shown to reduce water mobility into internal seed tissues during imbibition, which would help to maintain seed buoyancy. Surprisingly, despite released mucilage being an excellent hydrogel it did not increase the rate of water uptake by internal seed tissues and is more likely to play a role in retaining water around the seed."], "answers": [[{"answer": "epidermal cells of the seed coat", "em": 1, "f1": 1.0, "start_index": 62, "end_index": 69}], [{"answer": "root cap", "em": 1, "f1": 1.0, "start_index": 229, "end_index": 230}], [{"answer": "epidermal cells", "em": 1, "f1": 1.0, "start_index": 39, "end_index": 42}], [{"answer": "SCE cells", "em": 1, "f1": 1.0, "start_index": 99, "end_index": 102}], [{"answer": "epidermal cells", "em": 1, "f1": 1.0, "start_index": 211, "end_index": 214}]]}

The growth and development of roots depend on the specification and maintenance of the root meristem. Here, we report a previously unknown role of TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC) in controlling root meristem size in Arabidopsis. The results showed that loss of function of TIC reduced root meristem length and cell number by decreasing the competence of meristematic cells to divide. This was due to the repressed expression of PIN genes for decreased acropetal auxin transport in tic-2, leading to low auxin accumulation in the roots responsible for reduced root meristem, which was verified by exogenous application of indole-3-acetic acid. Downregulated expression of PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2, key transcription factors in mediating the patterning of the root stem cell niche, was also assayed in tic-2. Similar results were obtained with tic-2 and wild-type plants at either dawn or dusk.

For the maintenance of meristems, the rate of differentiation of daughter cells must equal the generation of new cells: How this is achieved is a central question in plant development. In the Arabidopsis root meristem, stem cells surround a small group of organizing cells, the quiescent center.

We found that aP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased in human THP-1 cells after rapamycin treatment. Exposure of human differentiated THP-1 cells to rapamycin led to a time- and dose-dependent induction of aP2 mRNA expression.

We isolated the AP2 gene and found that it encodes a putative nuclear protein that is distinguished by an essential 68-amino acid repeated motif, the AP2 domain. Consistent with its genetic functions, we determined that AP2 is expressed at the RNA level in all four types of floral organs--sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels--and in developing ovules. Thus, AP2 gene transcription does not appear to be spatially restricted by the floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS as predicted by previous studies.

LEC2 overexpression causes vegetative tissues to change their developmental fate to an embryonic state; however, little information exists about the cellular changes that take place. We show that LEC2 alters leaf morphology and anatomy and causes embryogenic structures to form subcellularly in leaves of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Chloroplasts accumulate more starch, the cytoplasm fills with oil bodies, and lytic vacuoles (LVs) appear smaller in size and accumulate protein deposits. Because LEC2 is responsible for activating the synthesis of seed storage proteins (SSPs) during seed development, SSP accumulation was investigated in leaves.

The three AfVIPs were expressed in both dormant and non-dormant embryos, but the abundance of AfVIP1 and 3 transcripts was greater in germinated than dormant seeds, whereas transcripts of AfVIP2 (and AfVP1) were more highly expressed in dormant embryos.", "Seeds represent the main source of nutrients for animals and humans, and knowledge of their biology provides tools for improving agricultural practices and managing genetic resources. There is also tremendous interest in using seeds as a sustainable alternative to fossil reserves for green chemistry. Seeds accumulate large amounts of storage compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins and oils. It would be useful for agro-industrial purposes to produce seeds that accumulate these storage compounds more specifically and at higher levels. The main metabolic pathways necessary for oil, starch or protein accumulation are well characterized. However, the overall regulation of partitioning between the various pathways remains unclear. Such knowledge could provide new molecular tools for improving the qualities of crop seeds (Focks and Benning, 1998, Plant Physiol. 118, 91). Studies to improve understanding of the genetic controls of seed development and metabolism therefore remain a key area of research. In the model plant Arabidopsis, genetic analyses have demonstrated that LEAFY COTYLEDON genes, namely LEC1, LEC2 and FUSCA3 (FUS3), are key transcriptional regulators of seed maturation, together with ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3). Interestingly, LEC2, FUS3 and ABI3 are related proteins that all contain a 'B3' DNA-binding domain.", "Aspects of transcriptional regulation in plants, such as the order in which transcriptional factors and the preinitiation complex are assembled, are obscure because studies carried out under conditions in which native chromatin structure is preserved are still few in comparison with those carried out under other conditions. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were used here to study the regulation of Pisum sativum psp54, which codes for the precursor of a chromatin-associated protein in dry seeds. Antibodies against PsSNF5, a component of the SWI/SNF remodelling complex, and against the transcriptional factor Pisum sativum abscisic acid insensitive 3 (PsABI3) were raised and used for ChIP experiments, which showed that both factors are bound to the psp54 promoter only when the gene is actively expressed during seed maturation and germination. However, RNA polymerase II appeared to be bound to the inactive promoter, which was poised for transcription, before the assembly of factors. Micrococcal nuclease protection assays showed that chromatin conformation at the proximal psp54 promoter changes in shifting from the active to inactive state. The changes in the promoter chromatin of psp54 are discussed.

The study found no significant difference at rest between the REC and DRES horses. During the posttraining measurements, however, the DRES horses showed, among others, a less sympathetic and increased parasympathetic dominance.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 64 African American and White men from diverse backgrounds, aged 40 to 64, from North Carolina. Regardless of race or education, men experienced DREs more negatively than colonoscopies because penetration with a finger was associated with a gay sexual act. Some men disliked colonoscopies, however, because they associated any penetration as an affront to their masculinity. Because beliefs did not differ by race, future research should focus on structural issues to examine why disparities persist with prostate and colorectal cancer.

However, linking common variants to genes that are causal for CKD etiology remains challenging. By adapting self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing, we evaluated the effect of genetic variation on DNA regulatory elements (DREs). Variants in linkage with the CKD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11959928 were shown to affect DRE function, illustrating that genes regulated by DREs colocalizing with CKD-associated variation can be dysregulated and therefore, considered as CKD candidate genes. To identify target genes of these DREs, we used circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) sequencing on glomerular endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells. Our 4C analyses revealed interactions of CKD-associated susceptibility regions with the transcriptional start sites of 304 target genes. Overlap with multiple databases confirmed that many of these target genes are involved in kidney homeostasis.

DREs with MS scores above the threshold were disproportionately distributed in close proximity to the transcription start site in all three species. Gene expression assays in hepatic mouse tissue confirmed the responsiveness of 192 genes possessing a putative DRE.

Stimulation occurs when the element is located upstream, but not downstream, the transcription initiation site. Activation requires both Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands and the leucine-charged domains (LCDs), analogous to those responsible for the interaction of the nuclear receptors with coregulators. Further more, DREAM can bind both 'in vitro' and in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to these elements. Importantly, 'in vivo' binding is only observed in vitamin D- or RA-treated cells.

To define the gene networks and developmental processes controlled by LEC1, genes regulated directly by and downstream of LEC1 were identified. We compared the mRNA profiles of wild-type and lec1-null mutant seeds at several stages of development to define genes that are down-regulated or up-regulated by the lec1 mutation. We used ChIP and differential gene-expression analyses in Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing LEC1 and in developing Arabidopsis and soybean seeds to identify globally the target genes that are transcriptionally regulated by LEC1 in planta Collectively, our results show that LEC1 controls distinct gene sets at different developmental stages, including those that mediate the temporal transition between photosynthesis and chloroplast biogenesis early in seed development and seed maturation late in development.

Here, we use a FUS3-GFP construct to show that the level of the FUS3 protein decreases dramatically during mid to late embryogenesis, whereas its mRNA is present at a high level. Deletion studies identify a C-terminal domain (CTD) that negatively regulates mRNA and protein levels, and mediates sensitivity to ABA and GA. Indeed, a CTD-truncated FUS3 variant accumulates at high level, and is insensitive to the destabilizing and stabilizing effects of GA and ABA, respectively. In contrast, fusion of various fragments of the CTD with GFP is sufficient to greatly reduce GFP fluorescence.

ChIP allows purification of in vivo protein-DNA complexes. The co-purified DNA is recovered and used to isolate the putatively regulated gene. Several tests must be performed to show that the putative downstream target gene is truly regulated by the DNA-binding protein. The DNA-binding regulatory protein must interact with cis regulatory elements. The downstream gene expression pattern should respond to the level of the trans-acting regulatory factor. The cis element should be able to confer regulation in response to the trans-acting factor. We describe, in this report, our ChIP protocol, and discuss in detail, tests to confirm regulation by AGL15 for two targets identified by ChIP. These targets are referred to as Downstream Target of AGL15 (DTA1 and DTA2). Expression of DTA1, which encodes a protein with high similarity to GA-2 oxidase-like proteins, is induced by AGL15.

Previous studies have shown that MADS domain proteins bind to DNA sequences with an overall consensus of CC(A/T)6GG (called a CArG motif). Nonetheless, different MADS domain proteins exhibit similar yet distinct binding site preferences that may be critical for differential gene regulation. To determine the consensus sequence preferentially bound by AGL15 in vitro, PCR-assisted binding site selection assays were performed. AGL15 was observed to prefer a CArG motif with a longer A/T-rich core and is to date the only plant MADS domain protein having such a preference. Next, the Arabidopsis genome data base was searched for genes containing AGL15 binding sites as candidates for direct regulation by AGL15.

This compromises recruitment of TTG1 to the GLABRA2 locus and downregulates GLABRA2 expression, which enhances biosynthesis of fatty acids in the embryo, but reduces production of mucilage and flavonoid pigments in the seed coat. Therefore, site-specific phosphorylation of TTG1 by SK11/SK12 regulates carbon partitioning between zygotic and maternal sinks in seeds.", "Plant trichomes and root hairs are powerful models for the study of cell fate determination. In Arabidopsis thaliana, trichome and root hair initiation requires a combination of three groups of proteins, including the WD40 repeat protein transparent TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1), R2R3 repeat MYB protein GLABRA1 (GL1), or werewolf (WER) and the IIIf subfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein GLABRA3 (GL3) or enhancer of GLABRA3 (EGL3). The bHLH component acts as a docking site for TTG1 and MYB proteins. Here, we isolated a mutant showing defects in trichome and root hair patterning that carried a point mutation (R173H) in AtMYC1 that encodes the fourth member of IIIf bHLH family protein. Genetic analysis revealed partial redundant yet distinct function between AtMYC1 and GL3/EGL3. GLABRA2 (GL2), an important transcription factor involved in trichome and root hair control, was down-regulated in Atmyc1 plants, suggesting the requirement of AtMYC1 for appropriate GL2 transcription. Like its homologs, AtMYC1 formed a complex with TTG1 and MYB proteins but did not dimerized.", "TTG1 (Transparent Testa Glabra 1), a WD-40 repeat protein, is involved in regulation of flavonoid/anthocyanin biosynthesis, seed coat (mucilage) development/pigmentation and trichome formation in leaves. Here, we characterized the TTG1 gene of Matthiola incana wild type (e locus), showing 85.3% similarity to TTG1 of A. thaliana on the nucleotide level and 96.2% on the protein level. A white-flowered and glabrous mutant, line 17, of M. incana exhibits one nucleotide change, leading to an amino acid substitution directly in the WD motif (W158R). Correspondingly, the DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase) gene, in which the expression is known to be dependent on TTG1, is not expressed in Matthiola mutant lines 17 (and 19). Comparison of the GC content of the Matthiola TTG1 (54.1%) and Arabidopsis TTG1 (46.1%) genes revealed a strong difference, mostly obtained by neutral substitutions (C to T transitions).", "In addition, we demonstrate that the maternal allele of the TTG1 gene suppresses the accumulation of storage proteins and fatty acids in seeds. Our results suggest that TTG1 is a direct target of FUS3 in the framework of the regulatory hierarchy controlling seed filling and regulates the accumulation of seed storage proteins and fatty acids during the seed maturation process."], "answers": [[{"answer": "WD40", "em": 0, "f1": 0.0, "start_index": 86, "end_index": 88}], [{"answer": "serine 215", "em": 0, "f1": 0.0, "start_index": 137, "end_index": 140}], [{"answer": "WD40 repeat protein transparent TESTA GLABRA1", "em": 0, "f1": 0.0, "start_index": 57, "end_index": 67}], [{"answer": "development/pigmentation", "em": 1, "f1": 1.0, "start_index": 66, "end_index": 71}], [{"answer": "seed maturation process", "em": 1, "f1": 1.0, "start_index": 87, "end_index": 91}]]}
